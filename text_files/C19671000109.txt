RECOMMENDATION ON FIXED FIRE EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL CATEGORY  

 SPACES The Assembly, Noting Article 16(i) of the IMCO Convention concerning the functions of  

 the Assembly, Noting also that at this session it adopted a new Part H of Chapter II in  

 the International convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, in aspect  

 of fire protection, fire detection and fire extinction in passenger ships  

 and, in particular, Regulation 108(c) which requires that each special  

 category space shall be fitted with an approved fixed fire extinguishing  

 system which shall protect all parts af any deck and vehicle platform, if  

 any, in such spaces, Recognizing that the adoption of specific requirements in respect of fixed  

 fire ectinguishing systems for the vehicle spaces of passenger ships having  

 drive-on/drive-off facilities might inhibit the development of new fire  

 extingushing systems for use in such spaces, Having considered the Recommendation on the fixed fire extinguishing  

 system for special category spaces adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee  

 at its fifteenth session (Annex II, MSC XV/22), Recommends that Contracting Governments when approving the fixed fire  

 extinguishing system for special category spaces, should satisfy themselves  

 that any such system is at least as effective in controlling a flowing petrol  

 fire as a fixed pressure water-spraying system, complying with the  

 requirements set out in the Annex to this Resolution, Invites governments concerned:
ANNEX RECOMMENDATION ON FIXED FIRE EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL CATEGORY  

 SPACES (* 1) A fixed fire extinguishing system for special category spaces be at least  

 as effective in controlling a flowing petrol fire as a pressure  

 water-spraying system complying with the following:
 and a capacity of at least 5 litres per square metre per minute (0.1  

 gallons per square foot per minute) for spaces with a deck height of 2.5  

 metres (8.2 feet) or more.
 (* 1) »Special category spaces« are those enclosed spaces above  

 or below the bulkhead deck intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with  

 fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion, into and from which such  

 vehicles can be driven and to which passengers have access.
