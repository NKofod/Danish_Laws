 Industriministeriet har underrettet IMO som følger:
 »Regulation 35 of Chapter III of the International Convention for the  

 Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, provides that every cargo ship, with certain  

 exceptions, shall carry lifeboats on each side of the ship of such aggregate  

 capacity as will accommodate all persons on board and in addition shall carry  

 liferafts sufficient to accomodate half that number.
 The Goverment of Denmark gives notification of acceptance of the following  

 Equivalent Arrangement under the provisions of Regulations 5, Chapter I:
 »Cargo vessels of 500 gross tons and over not less than 1600 gross  

 tons, except tankers, ships carrying liquefied gases in bulk and ships  

 carrying chemicals in bulk, may be equipped as follows:
 In accepting this Equivalent Arrangement the Government of Denmark has  

 taken account of experience gained from ships not subject to the Safety of  

 Life at Sea Convention, 1974, which have been operating with similar scales  

 of equipment.
 The Government of Denmark also gives notification that its Equivalent  

 Arrangement notified in SLS.2/Circ. 146 is hereby cancelled.
 Søfartsstyrelsen skal henlede opmærksomheden på, ækvivalensordningen  

 udelukkende indebærer erstatning af redningsbåde med flåder på de nærmere  

 angivne vilkår og ikke udelades af de i forbindelse med redningsbåde knyttede  

 foranstaltninger, såsom nødblus til belysning af søen m.m.
