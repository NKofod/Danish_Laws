L: DE, VW, D * * * NOTER Designator P og T  Resolutionstekstens nr. 3.4.1, note (C): Som angivet i bekendtgørelsens § 2, stk. 2, gælder kravet om indberetning af oplysninger om farligt gods ikke, når sådanne oplysninger allerede er blevet indberettet i overensstemmelse med Europa-Parlamentets og Rådets direktiv 2002/59/EF, som ændret ved direktiv 2009/17/EF om oprettelse af et trafikovervågnings- og trafikinformationssystem for skibsfarten i Fællesskabet (overvågningsdirektivet), der i artikel 13 fastlægger indberetningspligt for skibe, der afgår eller anløber en EU-havn.
For at lette rapporteringsproceduren anbefales det, at skibe, der allerede har indberettet oplysninger om farligt gods via SafeSeaNeteller er omfattet af en undtagelse, via SOUNDREP informerer om, at indberetning har fundet sted, eller at skibet er undtaget fra indberetningspligten.
Designator P  ladning og farligt gods (Appendix 3): Det er i IMO-resolution MSC.314(88) forudsat, at ladning og farligt gods angives med AIS.
De krævede oplysninger om ladning og farligt gods kan imidlertid ikke gives med AIS.
Dette gøres i stedet ved e-mail, fax mv., alternativt med VHF ved passage af en meldelinje eller før afgang fra havn eller ankerplads.
 1) Direktivet er delvist implementeret ved bekendtgørelse nr. 1286 af 24. november 2010 om indberetning af oplysninger om farligt eller forurenende gods om bord på skibe.
