 of Aircraft/Missile Accidents/Incidents.
Aim 1.  

  

 The aim of this agreement is to lay  

 down procedures which may be followed in the event of maritime incidents  

 involving  

 units or personnel of two or more NATO nations.
Agreement 2.  

  

 Participating nations agree to three  

 alternative procedures which should be used for the conduct of inquiries into  

 such man-time incidents.
The purpose of these inquiries would be to ascertain  

 the facts, to reach conclusions as to the direct and indirect causes of the  

 event and, if needed, to make recommendations to prevent a recurrence.
 3.  

  

 The alternatives are:
a.  

  

 Procedure A.
Combined Board of  

 Inquiry.
b.  

  

 Procedure B.
A National Inquiry  

 Attended by Witnesses and/or Observers from Other Nations.
c.  

  

 Procedure C.
Independent National  

 Inquiries Coordinated by the Presidents of those Inquiries.
The Major NATO Commander or Major Subordinate  

 Commander under whose command the units or personnel concerned were operating  

 should recommend the procedure he deems most appropriate for each specific  

 incident.
Nations are free to accept the NATO Commanders recommendation  

 or to  

 choose an alternative procedure in consultation with each other.
Where there  

 is no common NATO Commander, the procedures to be used should be determined  

 and  

 initiated as agreed between the nations concerned.
 4.  

  

 Nations retain all their existing  

 rights to conduct their own investigations in accordance with their own laws  

 or  

 regulations.
Procedure  

 A - Combined Board of Inquiry 5.  

  

 A Combined Board of Inquiry will be  

 convened by the appropriate Major NATO or Major NATO Subordinate Commander or  

 as agreed by the nations concerned.
The convening authority will appoint  

 officers  

 to form the Combined Board, which shall be composed of a minimum of 3  

 officers,  

 with each nation involved in the incident represented.
The President of the  

 Board is to be superior in rank, and if practicable, the other members are to  

 be equal or superior in rank to any person who may be affected by the  

 findings  

 of the Board.
6.  

  

 Combined Boards are to be held in  

 private and the record of the proceedings as well as the subsequent reports  

 shall be treated as privileged documents and shall only be used for official  

 purposes.
Information concerning the proceedings, testimony, findings,  

 conclusions and recommendations shall not be released publicity without the  

 agreement of all nations involved.
 7.  

  

 The conduct of the inquiry is to be  

 in accordance with Annex A to this STANAG.
8.  

  

 The report of the Board of Inquiry  

 is to be forwarded by the President to the convening authority, copies being  

 sent direct to the Ministries of Defence of the nations involved.
A verbatim  

 transcript of all oral evidence given before the Board, together with all  

 relevant data and documents presented to or prepared by the Board, should be  

 included.
 9.  

  

 The costs will be met in accordance  

 with established NATO procedures, i.e. administrative and transportation  

 costs  

 are the responsibility of the convening authority and per diem expenses are a  

 national responsibility.
Procedure  

 B - A National Inquiry Attended by Witnesses and/or Observers From Other  

 Nations 10.  

  

 Boards of Inquiry will be convened  

 by the appropriate national authorities, who will request the attendance of  

 witnesses  

 from other nations.
Such witnesses may give evidence under the laws and  

 procedures of the convening nation or if this is not acceptable to the  

 nations  

 involved, may give evidence under the rules for witnesses at a Combined Board  

 (Annex A). Observers from the nations concerned may be present during the  

 relevant  

 part of the discussions.
11.  

  

 Unless otherwise agreed, the  

 evidence of each foreign witness, and any findings which affect him, are to  

 be  

 forwarded to the nation concerned.
Evidence and findings of concern to NATO  

 shall be forwarded to the relevant NATO Commander by the national  

 authorities.
 12.  

  

 The nation convening the inquiry  

 shall be responsible for the cost of attendance of foreign witnesses.
Procedure  

 C - Independent National Inquiries Coordinated by the Presidents of the  

 Inquiries 13.  

  

 Inquiries under this procedure  

 consist of two phases.
In the first phase, each National authority concerned  

 appoints its own Board of Inquiry acting in accordance with national rules  

 and  

 regulations and hearing evidence only from its own nationals.
During this  

 phase  

 the Presidents of the Boards of Inquiry shall exchange initial national  

 reports of the incident.
If they consider it necessary, the Presidents may  

 meet  

 in order to obtain or exchange any further information they deem appropriate  

 to the establishment of the facts.
14.  

  

 In the second phase, the reports  

 drawn up by the national Boards of Inquiry are compared by a Combined  

 Commission composed of the Presidents of the National Boards with any other  

 members agreed by the nations concerned.
The Combined Commission then  

 prepares  

 a summary showing where the reports agree and where they differ.
The summary  

 is  

 sent to the Ministries of Defence of the nations involved, and if applicable,  

 to the NATO authorities concerned.
 15.  

  

 The combined summary and any  

 information exchanged between the Presidents of the National Boards of  

 Inquiry  

 shall only be used for official purposes and are not to be released without  

 the  

 con-sent of all the nations concerned.
Implementation  

 of the Agreement 16.  

  

 This STANAG is considered to be implemented  

 when Nations and Major NATO Commanders have issued the necessary  

 orders/instructions  

 to the forces concerned putting the procedures detailed in this agreement  

 into  

 effect.
