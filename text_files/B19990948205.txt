MINIMUM OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR AIRCRAFT EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTERS (121.5/243 MHz and 406 MHz) ED-62 Mai 1990 1.2 TYPES OF ELT 1.2.1 Four basic types of ELT are described in this document.
They  

 are:
 Automatic Fixed (ELT (AF)), Automatic Portable (ELT (AP)), Survival (ELT  

 (S)) and Automatic Deployable (ELT (AD)).
The use of the suffix "Automatic" is for editorial purpose and  

 is not intended to preclude the design, manufacture or use of manually  

 activated ELTs.
The requirement for and approval of automatic or manual  

 activation methods is the prerogative of individual approval authorities.
In applying these minimum operational performance specifications to  

 manually activated ELT equipments, all reference to automatic activation  

 methods and crash sensors should be ignored.
In all other respects, the  

 specifications contained in this document shall apply to all ELTs, whether  

 manually or automatically activated.
1.2.1.1 Automatic Fixed (ELT (AF)) This type of ELT is intended to be permanently attached to the aircraft  

 before and after a crash.
1.2.1.2 Automatic Portable (ELT (AP)) This type of ELT is intended to be rigidly attached to the aircraft before  

 a crash, but readily removable from the aircraft after a crash.
It may also  

 function as an ELT (AF) during the crash sequence.
If the ELT does not  

 include an integral antenna, the aircraft-mounted antenna may be disconnected  

 and an auxiliary antenna (stored on the ELT case) connected in its place.
The  

 ELT can be tethered to a survivor or a life raft.
1.2.1.3 Survival (ELT (S)) This type of ELT is intended to be removed from the aircraft, deployed and  

 activated by survivors of a crash.
It can be tethered to a life raft or a  

 survivor.
Activation of an ELT (S) is usually by manual means but automatic  

 activation (eg: by water activation) may apply.
1.2.1.4 Automatic Deployable (ELT (AD)) This type of ELT is intended to be rigidly attached to the aircraft before  

 a crash and ejected and deployed a. manually (during the crash sequence), or b. automatically (after the crash sensor has determined that a crash has  

 occurred).
3 MINIMUM PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS UNDER STANDARD TEST  

 CONDITIONS 3.1 MINIMUM PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION - 121.5/243 MHz ELT 3.1.1 Operating Frequencies 3.1.1.1 The operating frequencies shall initially be set at a. 	121,5 MHz±6 kHz, and b. 	243,0 MHz±12 kHz.
3.1.1.2 The transmitted medium term frequency stability shall be defined  

 by the mean slope of the frequency vs time over a 15 minute period and by the  

 residual frequency deviation about the mean slope.
The mean slope shall not  

 exceed 0.2 parts/million/minute.
The RMS frequency deviation about the mean  

 slope shall not exceed 0.5 parts/million.
3.1.2 Modulation Characteristics 3.1.2.1 The rf carriers shall be amplitude modulated.
The modulation  

 factor shall be at least 0.85 but shall not exceed 1.0. (see Figure  

 3-1).
NOTE: The figure specified for modulation factor assumes a  

 sinusoidal modulating signal.

 other than sinusoidal, the modulation factor due to the fundamental component  

 of the modulating signal shall be at least 0.85.
 3.1.2.2 The frequency of the modulating signal shall sweep DOWNWARDS over  

 a range of not less than 700 Hz within the limits of 1 600 Hz to 300 Hz with  

 a sweep repetition rate between 2 Hz and 4 Hz.
 NOTE: If the 121.5/243.0 MHz ELT is part of a combined unit with  

 a 406 MHz locator beacon, the frequency of the modulating signal may  

 optionally sweep UPWARDS over the same range and within the same limits and  

 repetition rate as specified in 3.1.2.2.
 3.1.2.3 The modulation signals applied to the carriers shall have a  

 minimum duty cycle of 33% and a maximum duty cycle of 55%. (see Figure  

 3-2).

 Regulations, and shall have one of the following characteristics:
 a. 	continuous carrier.
 b. 	carrier keyed in such a manner that full power is applied to the  

 antenna for one period, followed by reduced or zero power for a further  

 period.
 The ON/OFF cycle shall be optimised to allow the precise location of the  

 beacon in all weather conditions and to ensure compatibility with all VHF  

 homing equipment currently in service.
 NOTE: It has been shown that an ON period of 0.75 seconds  

 followed by an OFF period of 1.5 seconds gives satisfactory results.
 3.1.3.2 The ELT shall have clearly defined sideband components which are  

 symmetric about the output signal spectrum and distinct from the carrier  

 component at both the 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz frequencies.

 distribution within a bandwidth of plus and minus 30 Hz about a fixed  

 reference frequency corresponding to the carrier component over the  

 audio/sweep modulation cycle.
 At 243 MHz 30% of the energy distribution shall fall within a bandwidth of  

 fc ±60 Hz.
 3.1.3.3 To aid SAR system detection and homing capabilities, the  

 transmission may also provide a period of unmodulated CW power for a duration  

 of 2.0 (±0.25) seconds, repeated every 8.0 (±0.8) seconds.
 3.1.3.4 Voice modulation, (A3E), is permitted provided that its use shall  

 not prejudice the primary function of the beacon and power shall not be  

 consumed at a greater rate than in the beacon mode.
 Such equipment shall also comply with the following requirements:
3.1.3.5 An identification signal is permitted using the International  

 Morse Code.
If this option is incorporated, 1 dot = 115 ±10) ms 1 dash = 3 dots space between morse digits = 1 dot space between coded letters = 1 dash 3.1.4 Antenna Radiation Characteristics The antenna shall radiate on 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz.

3.1.5 Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power The Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) shall not be less than -10  

 dBW (100 mW) or greater than -4 dBW (400 mW), on each frequency.
NOTE: Where it is required to establish Equivalent Isotropic  

 Radiated Power it may be taken as the output power at the transmitter  

 terminal, minus feeder and mismatch losses, plus average aerial gain relative  

 to an isotropic radiator in the horizontal direction, or EIRP (dBW) = PT - L + GA, where PT = transmitter output power, (dBW) L  = feeder and mismatch losses, (dB) GA = aerial gain, (dB) 3.1.7  Radio Frequency Intermodulation (Does not apply to ELT (S)) When the ELT unit is in the ARMED mode, the application of any two

 electromagnetic fields, which have an electric field intensity equal to the  

 levels, specified in Table 5-2 of paragraph 5.2.7, to the external  

 surface of the aircraft test configuration shall not result in a third field  

 with an intensity greater than 7 microvolts/meter in the 108 MHz - 37 MHz  

 band, at a suitable receiving antenna placed 2 metres from the ELT  

 antenna.
3.1.9 Transmitter Turn-on At the maximum and minimum operating temperatures, the EIRP level at

 residual frequency deviation about the mean slope.
The mean slope shall not  

 exceed 0.001 parts/million/minute.
The RMS frequency deviation about the mean  

 slope shall not exceed 0.003 parts per million.
 3.2.1.5 For ELTs manufactured prior to 1 January 1991, relaxation of the  

 requirements regarding medium-term stability is acceptable as follows:
3.2.2 Digital Message Generator The digital message generator shall key the modulator and transmitter so  

 that the message defined in C/S T.001* is transmitted.
* 3.2.2.1 Repetition Rate 3.2.2.2 Total Transmission Time The total transmission time shall be 440 ms ±1%, for the standard short  

 message, and 520 ms ±1% for the optional long message.
3.2.2.3 CW Preamble The initial 160 ms ±1% of the transmitted signal shall consist of an  

 unmodulated carrier at the transmitter frequency measured at the 90% power

 COSPAS/SARSAT Specification C/S T.001.
 C/S T.001 specifies transmitter output power into an antenna of defined  

 characteristics.
This Minimum Operational Performance Specification  specifies performance  

 in terms of EIRP which is performance related rather than design oriented.  

 The manufacturer is thus allowed a greater degree of flexibility in meeting  

 the performance requirements by means best suited to individual design.
Note,  

 however, that the above EIRP requirement is a more demanding performance  

 specification than that defined in C/S T.001 and equipment designed to C/S  

 T.001 may not satisfy the requirements of this Minimum Operational  

 Performance Specification.
 3.2.5.2  The transmitter output power rise time shall be less than 5 ms,  

 measured between the 10% and 90% power points.

 this MOPS, except for those in paragraph 3.2.5 (EIRP), when the transmitter  

 is terminated with a load mismatched from the design impedance by a factor of  

 3, and shall not be damaged by any load from open circuit to short  

 circuit.
3.2.8 Maximum Continuous Transmission The 406 MHz ELT shall be designed to limit any continuous transmission  

 caused by equipment failure to a maximum of 45 seconds.
3.2.9 Spurious Emissions and Carrier Harmonics 3.2.9.1 The limits of spurious emissions measured against the level of  

 the unmodulated carrier shall be as shown in Figure 3-8.
 3.2.9.2 Carrier harmonics shall be at least 30 dB below the level of the  

 unmodulated carrier.
3.2.10 Radio Frequency Susceptibility When the ELT unit is in the ARMED mode, it shall not be activated or  

 damaged when a signal in the bands 88 MHz to 137 MHz and 420 MHz to 460 MHz  

 (excluding the band 121 MHz to 122 MHz) at a level of +23 dBm is directly  

 coupled to the ELT antenna terminal.

ELECTRICAL TEST PROCEDURES 5.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 5.1.1 Shielded Room and Test Transmissions Unless otherwise specified, ELT testing must be conducted in a  

 shielded room or metal enclosure.
Bench and ground tests conducted outside of  

 a shielded room should not be performed on 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz; off-set  

 crystals MUST be used.
Test transmissions on 406 MHz must have a frame  

 synchronisation pattern of 011 010 000 to ensure that the signals are not  

 processed by the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites.
5.1.2 Power Input Voltage Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted with the ELT  

 using its self-contained battery connected in the normal mode of operation.  

 The voltage, of external power supplies, eg: to Control and Monitor  

 system(s), shall be adjusted to the declared design voltage ±5% and shall be  

 measured at the equipment input terminals.
5.1.3 Adjustment of Equipment The circuits of the equipment under test shall be properly aligned and  

 adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer s recommended practice prior to  

 application of the specified tests.
5.1.4 Test Instrument Precautions Precautions shall be taken while carrying out the tests to prevent the  

 introduction of errors resulting from the improper connexion of test  

 instruments to the equipment under test.
5.1.5 Ambient Conditions Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted under conditions  

 of ambient room temperature, pressure and humidity, as defined in  

 ED-14C/DO-160C, paragraph 3.4.
5.1.6 Connected Loads Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the  

 equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is  

 designed.
5.1.7 Warm-up Period Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted after a warm-up  

 period of not less than 5 minutes.
5.1.8 Recording of Test Results When test results are being recorded for inclusion in the type test  

 report, it is not sufficient to note merely that the requirement was met.  

 Except where tests are obviously CO/NO-GO in character, (eg: determination of  

 whether or not mechanical devices function correctly), the actual numerical  

 values obtained for each of the parameters tested shall be recorded.
5.1.9 Test Procedures 5.1.9.1 The following test procedures are considered to be a satisfactory  

 means of determining required performance under standard and stressed  

 environmental conditions.
5.1.9.2 Although test procedures are specified, it is recognised that  

 other methods may be preferred.
Such other procedures may be used if the  

 manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.
The  

 procedures described in this chapter  should be used as criteria in  

 evaluation the acceptability of alternative procedures.

5.3 DETAILED TEST PROCEDURES - 406 MHZ ELT 5.3.1 General The test procedures required by COSPAS-SARSAT are described in the  

 COSPAS-SARSAT Type Approval Standard, (Document C/S T.007). This section  

 describes accepted measurement methods for the parameters defined in Chapter  

 3 of C/S T 007. Different measuring techniques may be approved by  

 COSPAS-SARSAT providing there is sufficient justification.
5.3.2 Test Bench 5.3.2.1 The particular characteristics of the COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz beacon  

 require the use of special test equipment, (STE), in addition to standard  

 measuring instruments, (eg: frequency counter, spectrum analyser, etc).  

Figure 5-3 shows an example of this test equipment set-up.
5.3.2.2 The message transmitted by the beacon is detected by a receiver  

 from which all the parameters to be measured are obtained.
Synchronisation  

 signals are generated by the STE which define the measurement intervals  

 S1, S2  and S3, as shown in Figure  

 5-4.
5.3.3 Transmitted Frequency (See Paragraph 3.2.1) 5.3.3.1 Nominal Value The mean transmission frequency, fo, is determined from 10  

 measurements of fi(1) made during the interval S1 during 10  

 successive transmission as follows.

 the stabilisation period, (the time origin for data analysis should be the  

 beginning of the stabilisation period), and A, B and fo are  

 constants to be determined from the least square fit.
 Using the above equation, the following conditions must be met.
fo = 406.025 (±0.002) MHz f(30) - fo = ±0.0003 MHz f(1 825) - fo= ±0.003 MHz* *(Alternatively, the manufacturer may demonstrate that the initial offset  

 plus temperature effects plus aging over 5 years is less than 0.005 MHz).
5.3.4 Message Format and Structure (see Figure 5-5) 5.3.4.1 Repetition Period The repetition period, TR, between the beginnings of two  

 successive transmissions, shall be random, in a uniform distribution, over  

 the range from 47.5 seconds to 52.5 seconds, (see paragraph 3.2.2). Uniform  

 distribution shall be determined from successive measurements over a five  

 minute period.

 a transmission and the beginning of the data modulation, shall satisfy the  

 following relationship where the mean value and the standard deviation are  

 derived from 10 successive measurements.
158.4 ms < T1 ±3 r  

  < 161.6 ms  (see paragraph 3.2.2) 5.3.4.3 Bit Rate and Stability The bit rate fb, which is measured over the first 50 bits  

 corresponding to one transmission, shall satisfy the following relationship  

 where the mean value and the standard deviation are derived from 10  

 successive measurements.
396 bps < fb ±3  r  

   < 404 bps (see paragraph 3.2.2) 5.3.4.4 Message Coding The content of the digital message is checked with the one provided by the  

 manufacturer.
The compliance with the format for each data field is checked  

 bit by bit.
The correctness of the error correcting code is also checked.
5.3.4.5 Data Encoding and Modulation The data encoding, the modulation sense, the modulation index and the  

 modulation rise time are checked by examining the biphase logic signal with  

 an oscilloscope.
