 Ved tiltrædelse af den internationale lasteliniekonvention (1966) tog Kina  

 følgende forbehold:
»With respect to its off-coast areas, the People's Republic of China  

 will not be bound by the defining of zones and seasonal areas in the relevant  

 provision of Regulations 49 and 50 of Annex II to the Convention.« Søfartsstyrelsen har i denne anledning ved en officiel henvendelse gennem  

 IMO til den kinesiske ambassade i London søgt oplyst, hvorledes forbeholdet  

 skulle forstås, og hvorledes det evt. kunne påvirke danske skibe, der anløber  

 kinesiske havne, og har modtaget følgende oplysning:
