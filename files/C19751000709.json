The Netherlands authority became a member of the Scheme  \r\n\r\n on 20th August 1976 and the authority from the Federal Republic of Germany on  \r\n\r\n 8th February 1978. For the purpose of the Scheme, ships' equipment means any  \r\n\r\n equipment, including lifesaving appliances and fire-extinguishing equipment,  \r\n\r\n which is subject to approval or acceptance by a Participating Authority in  \r\n\r\n the Scheme. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Purpose and principles of the Scheme </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The purpose of the Scheme is to facilitate trade in ships' equipment. It  \r\n\r\n allows certain tests and inspections required by a Participating Authority of  \r\n\r\n the importing country to be carried out by a Participating Authority of the  \r\n\r\n exporting country. Exporters are thus saved the cost and time required of  \r\n\r\n having a surveyor from the importing country sent to undertake the tests and  \r\n\r\n inspections in the exporting country or to send samples of the ships'  \r\n\r\n equipment intended for export to the importing country for testing and  \r\n\r\n inspection. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>No harmonization of the technical regulations of the countries adhering to  \r\n\r\n the Scheme, nor of their test procedures, is provided for under the Scheme.  \r\n\r\n Any items of ships' equipment to be exported to another country participating  \r\n\r\n in the Scheme have to comply with the requirements of the Participating  \r\n\r\n Authority of that country. The test procedures prescribed by the importing  \r\n\r\n country shall also be followed. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Common requirements </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Participating Authorities have found, however, that the practical  \r\n\r\n application of the Scheme would be facilitated if regulations and provisions  \r\n\r\n which are commonly agreed between the countries adhering to the Scheme, were  \r\n\r\n compiled and published. Such publication would also facilitate the  \r\n\r\n manufacturing of goods for export to other countries adhering to the Scheme.  \r\n\r\n Therefore the Participating Authorities have established &#187;common  \r\n\r\n requirements&#171; for some items of ships' equipment. The common  \r\n\r\n requirements are not international standards. Their purpose is not to replace  \r\n\r\n the national requirements in force in the countries adhering to the Scheme  \r\n\r\n but rather to express the common features, the &#187;least common  \r\n\r\n denominator&#171;, of these national requirements. Therefore common  \r\n\r\n requirements do not preclude a Participating Authority from having other  \r\n\r\n requirements additional to the common requirements. Anyone who intends to  \r\n\r\n avail himself of the facilities of the Scheme is advised to ask the  \r\n\r\n Participating Authority of the importing country if there are any national  \r\n\r\n requirements additional to the common requirements. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>How to profit from the facilities offered by the Scheme </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>A person or enterprise wishing to obtain approval or acceptance of ships'  \r\n\r\n equipment from another country participating in the Scheme or his authorized  \r\n\r\n representative shall, by referring to the Scheme, forward to the  \r\n\r\n Participating Authority whose approval or acceptance he wishes to obtain,  \r\n\r\n designs and specifications in respect of that equipment. He shall also  \r\n\r\n provide details of possible certification of the equipment he is intending to  \r\n\r\n export by the authorities of other countries. The procedure required by the  \r\n\r\n Participating Authority whose approval or acceptance is requested shall be  \r\n\r\n observed. The Participating Authority whose approval or acceptance has been  \r\n\r\n requested will then declare to the Participating Authority which is to  \r\n\r\n undertake the tests and inspections whether the designs and specifications  \r\n\r\n are in accordance with its regulations or are otherwise acceptable to it. The  \r\n\r\n Participating Authority in the importing country whose approval or acceptance  \r\n\r\n is requested may request the Participating Authority in the exporting country  \r\n\r\n to undertake on its behalf inspections of the production facilities of the  \r\n\r\n manufacturer, surveillance of production, inspection and tests of the  \r\n\r\n prototype and issuance of reports, certificates and other documentary  \r\n\r\n materiel to the extent that such tests and inspections are required by the  \r\n\r\n Participating Authority whose approval or acceptance is requested. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Participating Authority which has carried out these operations shall  \r\n\r\n submit the reports and certificates to the Participating Authority on whose  \r\n\r\n behalf they have been undertaken. The latter will, if satisfied, grant final  \r\n\r\n approval or acceptance of the relevant items of ships' equipment, requesting  \r\n\r\n the other Participating Authority to test, inspect and report on subsequent  \r\n\r\n production of the item of equipment which has been approved or accepted. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>It should be noted that the initial inspection of production facilities  \r\n\r\n and inspection and tests of the prototype may be carried out by the  \r\n\r\n Participating Authority whose approval or acceptance is requested. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Fees </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Participating Authority which carries out tests and inspections on  \r\n\r\n behalf of the importing authority may collect from the person or enterprise  \r\n\r\n exporting the equipment such fees and expenses as it deems appropriate to  \r\n\r\n cover the service. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>SCHEME FOR THE RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>OF TESTS AND INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>ON SHIPS' EQUIPMENT </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The purpose of this Scheme is to facilitate trade in ships' equipment by  \r\n\r\n allowing certain tests and inspections required by a Participating Authority  \r\n\r\n of the importing country to be carried out by another Participating Authority  \r\n\r\n of the exporting country. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Explanation of terms </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> For the purpose of this Scheme: </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(a) &#187;SHIPS&#171; EQUIPMENT' means any equipment, including  \r\n\r\n life-saving appliances and fire-extinguishing equipment, which is subject to  \r\n\r\n the requirements and approval of or acceptance by a Participating Authority;  \r\n\r\n</LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) &#187;PARTICIPATING AUTHORITY&#171; means the administration in a  \r\n\r\n country which is competent to approve or accept ships' equipment in relation  \r\n\r\n to national regulations and which participates in this Scheme.

Suitable end  \r\n\r\n fittings must be provided. In particular the metal and wall thickness of  \r\n\r\n union nuts must be sufficiently robust to withstand a reasonable degree of  \r\n\r\n over tightening.
