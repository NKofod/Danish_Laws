Now that the three main documents involved are in final  \r\n\r\n form and have been agreed or endorsed as appropriate by Eurogroup Ministers,  \r\n\r\n it is timely to publish them together in this booklet, together with an  \r\n\r\n explanation of their usefulness, not only to logistic staffs, but also to  \r\n\r\n those working in the field of procurement who might be asked to respond to  \r\n\r\n requests for assistance from logisticians. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The management of international weapons projects is far from simple. The  \r\n\r\n factors underlying decisions increase in proportion to the number of  \r\n\r\n countries. Worse, countries may join or leave at different stages. The result  \r\n\r\n is that such weapons projects often have at their foundations a complex web  \r\n\r\n of agreements and understandings between countries, agencies, consortia and  \r\n\r\n firms. During this early and crucial stage it is unlikely that much thought  \r\n\r\n will have been given to the logistic support of the weapon - after all, the  \r\n\r\n procurement staffs are quite rightly giving all their attention to ensuring  \r\n\r\n that the Armed Forces receive the desired equipment at the right time. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The eventual equipment has, however, to be supported by logisticians for  \r\n\r\n perhaps twenty years and the cost of this in-service phase can be of the same  \r\n\r\n order as the initial outlay. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Unfortunately, it is often the case that the very practical and necessary  \r\n\r\n decisions reached by procurement authorities mean that it is difficult,  \r\n\r\n sometimes impossible, to set up rational, cooperative logistic support and  \r\n\r\n thereby reap the benfits - economy, standardisation, flexibility - that were  \r\n\r\n supposed to flow from the collaboration. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>With this in mind EUROLOG formulated Principles of Co-operation  in  \r\n\r\n Logistics which picked up a theme from EURONAD's Principles of Equipment  \r\n\r\n Collaboration that co-ordinated logistics should be automatically considered  \r\n\r\n as part of any collaborative project. In London on 7 May 1975 EUROGROUP  \r\n\r\n Ministers signed a Declaration (reproduced in this booklet) adopting the  \r\n\r\n Logistics Principles. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>It remained to ensure that the Principles were translated into practice.  \r\n\r\n EUROLOG therefore drew up Guidelines which gave more specific direction as to  \r\n\r\n how co-operative logistic support of collaborative weapons should be pursued.  \r\n\r\n This document too was approved by EUROGROUP Ministers. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The task now fell on EUROLOG and its sub-groups to monitor the  \r\n\r\n implementation of the Principles and Guidelines. To give national logistics  \r\n\r\n staffs some guidance as to what logistics considerations should be taken into  \r\n\r\n account at the various stages of a project, a Procedure was drawn up, based  \r\n\r\n on the phases as defined in the NATO Periodic Armaments Planning System. This  \r\n\r\n Procedure should encourage uniformity of practice between the EUROGROUP  \r\n\r\n countries. It is not designed for literal application in every country,  \r\n\r\n because of differing administrative structures and practices but is intended  \r\n\r\n as a model which countries should strive to translate into their own context  \r\n\r\n through appropriate adjustments. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The successful application of these three documents rest on close liaison  \r\n\r\n between logistics and procurement staffs. In some countries this is  \r\n\r\n accomplished automatically through integration of the two functions. In  \r\n\r\n others there is a difficult gap to bridge. Recognizing the problem of those  \r\n\r\n logistics staffs who do not have automatic access to procurement staffs,  \r\n\r\n Ministers acknowledged (EG/27/80 (Final)) in 1980 &#187;that national members  \r\n\r\n of EUROLOG Sub-Groups were exercising their monitoring responsibilities in  \r\n\r\n regard to arrangements for follow-on logistic support of collaborative  \r\n\r\n weapons projects on behalf of EUROGROUP Ministers and with authority derived  \r\n\r\n from them&#171;. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>I hope that this booklet, which brings into one volume the fruits of five  \r\n\r\n years work by EUROLOG, will be of assistance (and perhaps also an  \r\n\r\n inspiration) to procurement and logistics staff, national and international.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Air Vice Marshal J J Miller </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>MOD United Kingdom </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Chairman, EUROLOG </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>DECLARATION ON EUROGROUP PRINCIPLES OF CO-OPERATION IN LOGISTICS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Ministers of Defence of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of  \r\n\r\n Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and the  \r\n\r\n United Kingdom: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Desiring to achieve a greater measure of collaboration in logistic support  \r\n\r\n among European member states of the North Atlantic Alliance; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Anxious to make optimum use of their logistic resources; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>on 7 May 1975 adopted the Principles of Co-operation in Logistics set out  \r\n\r\n in the Annex herewith as a basis for common action. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Ministers confirm their understanding that each will: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- Act in compliance with these principles; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- Disseminate them within his national Defence Ministry; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- Instruct all those of his staffs who have responsibility for logistics  \r\n\r\n to act in accordance with these principles. </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n  PAUL VANDEN BOEYNANTS  \r\n\r\n Minister of National Defence  \r\n\r\n Belgium  \r\n\r\n  EMILE KRIEPS  \r\n\r\n Minister of Defence  \r\n\r\n Luxembourg  \r\n\r\n  ORLA MØLLER  \r\n\r\n Minister of Defence  \r\n\r\n Denmark  \r\n\r\n  HENK VREDELING  \r\n\r\n Minister of Defence  \r\n\r\n The Netherlands  \r\n\r\n  GEORG LEBER  \r\n\r\n Minister of Defence  \r\n\r\n Federal Republic of Germany  \r\n\r\n  ALV JAKOB FOSTERVOLL  \r\n\r\n Minister of Defence  \r\n\r\n Norway  \r\n\r\n  BYRON THEODOROPOULOS  \r\n\r\n Permanent Representative to NATO  \r\n\r\n acting for the  \r\n\r\n Minister of National Defence  \r\n\r\n Greece  \r\n\r\n  FERIT MELEN  \r\n\r\n Minister of National Defence  \r\n\r\n Turkey  \r\n\r\n  ARNALDO FORLANI  \r\n\r\n Minister of Defence  \r\n\r\n Italy  \r\n\r\n  ROY MASON  \r\n\r\n Secretaty of State for Defence  \r\n\r\n United Kingdom  \r\n\r\n London 7 May 1975  \r\n\r\n ANNEX  \r\n\r\n EUROLOG PRINCIPLES OF CO-OPERATION IN LOGISTICS  \r\n\r\n I OBJECTIVES  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> One of the important overall objectives of the  \r\n\r\n Eurogroup is to increase co-operation in defence among member nations. The  \r\n\r\n field of logistics is one in which there is scope for improvements of this  \r\n\r\n kind. Although the provision of logistic support for NATO-assigned forces is  \r\n\r\n at present a national responsibility, closer collaboration in logistic  \r\n\r\n support will enable member countries whose forces are deployed in the same  \r\n\r\n area with similar or complementary operational responsibilities to make more  \r\n\r\n efficient and economical use of their logistic resources. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>2.</B> The ultimate objective is to achieve the closest  \r\n\r\n possible integration of logistics systems among Eurogroup members in respect  \r\n\r\n of the forces they assign to NATO. This is, however, dependent on fundamental  \r\n\r\n changes in the arrangements for financing those logistics systems and for the  \r\n\r\n procurement of equipment; and also on the achievement of much greater  \r\n\r\n standardization of weapons and equipment than exists at present. In the  \r\n\r\n meantime, worthwhile progress towards the objective can be made by developing  \r\n\r\n co- operative logistic arrangements and co-ordinated procedures wherever the  \r\n\r\n opportunity exists and greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness would  \r\n\r\n result. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>II PRINCIPLES </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>3.</B> The following principles have been drawn up to  \r\n\r\n provide a basis for co-operation in the field of logistic support:. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. New Collaborative Projects for Weapons Systems and Major  Equipments.  \r\n\r\n Practical possibilities of collaboration in support of weapons systems and  \r\n\r\n major equipments (egg, maintenance, repair and spares provisioning) are  \r\n\r\n limited by the differences between weapons and equipments at present used by  \r\n\r\n the member countries. A major effort is now being made by Eurogroup contries  \r\n\r\n through the work of EURONAD to promote standardization of new weapons and  \r\n\r\n equipment by means of collaborative projects. Member countries have already  \r\n\r\n agreed in the Principles of Equipment Collaboration that the requirement to  \r\n\r\n attempt to evolve co-ordinated arrangements for follow-on support be an  \r\n\r\n automatic accompaniment of any collaborative procurement project. EUROLOG  \r\n\r\n will work with the relevant agencies to satisfy themselves that appropriate  \r\n\r\n arrangements are being made in each case. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. Other New Equipment Projects . Member countries agree that a similar  \r\n\r\n effort to evolve co-ordinated arrangements for follow-on support should be  \r\n\r\n made when any new weapon or equipment is under consideration or adopted by  \r\n\r\n two or more countries, whether or not the particular item is categorized as a  \r\n\r\n collaborative procurement project. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>c. Existing Weapons or Equipments. Member countries agree that  \r\n\r\n consideration should be given to the possibility of co-operation in the  \r\n\r\n logistic support of existing weapons and equipments used by more than one  \r\n\r\n country which are not already the subject of co-operative arrangements. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>d. Harmonization of Logistic Procedures. Member countries agree that every  \r\n\r\n effort will be made to harmonize/standardize logistic procedures with the  \r\n\r\n object of achieving increased flexibility in logistic support. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>e. Future Logistic Planning. Member countries agree that they should  \r\n\r\n exchange information regularly about logistics, including information on  \r\n\r\n planned logistic projects, with the general aim of enabling others to join in  \r\n\r\n such projects if this would be of advantage. They agree also that there  \r\n\r\n should be a regular exchange of information on the evaluation of national  \r\n\r\n logistic concepts. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>III METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>4.</B> Responsibility for implementation of these  \r\n\r\n principles lies with Eurogroup countries, under the directiom of Eurogroup  \r\n\r\n Ministers. The sub-group established in the field of logistics (EUROLOG) has  \r\n\r\n so far devoted its main efforts to examining the possibilities of logistics  \r\n\r\n co-operation between the land forces in the Northern Army Group, between the  \r\n\r\n air forces in the Second Allied Tactical Air Force and between the navies  \r\n\r\n which operate in the Channel and the North Sea. The countries providing these  \r\n\r\n forces are at present represented on EUROLOG. It is open to other Eurogroup  \r\n\r\n countries to join EUROLOG when subjects of interest to them are under  \r\n\r\n consideration. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>GUIDELINES POR COLLABORATION IN LOGISTIC FOLLOW-ON SUPPORT FOR MAJOR  \r\n\r\n WEAPONS/EQUIPMENT TO BE INTRODUCED IN EUROGROUP COUNTRIES </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> INTRODUCTION </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The logistics required for the efficient and economical support of a new  \r\n\r\n weapon or major equipment, being introduced into the forces of two or more of  \r\n\r\n the EUROGROUP countries under collaborative or other arrangements, are  \r\n\r\n dependent upon such a wide range of factors that it is not possible to lay  \r\n\r\n down detailed procedures for universal application. Some guidelines for the  \r\n\r\n development of logistic support for such projects can be laid down, however,  \r\n\r\n providing it is accepted that the final arrangements are likely to vary in  \r\n\r\n each case. This memorandum has therefore been prepared by EUROLOG to provide  \r\n\r\n general guidance to nations considering the logistic support needed for  \r\n\r\n common weapon systems or major equipment to be used by two or more of the  \r\n\r\n EUROGROUP countries. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>2.</B> AIM </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>It is of the first importance to increase substantially the extent and  \r\n\r\n depth of the follow-on support of the defence equipment of the participating  \r\n\r\n countries. The aim of these guidelines is to ensure the adoption of a  \r\n\r\n consultative process among the EUROGROUP countries which lead to their  \r\n\r\n improved collaboration, with particular reference to the avoidance of  \r\n\r\n wasteful duplication among the participating countries in this area and the  \r\n\r\n realisation of both the economic and military benefits of enhanced  \r\n\r\n standardisation. The guidelines are in this respect an extension and  \r\n\r\n implementation of the approved &#187;Principles of Co-operation in  \r\n\r\n Logistics&#171; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>3.</B> GENERAL GUIDELINES </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. The prime object of the participating nations should be to establish  \r\n\r\n collaborative arrangements for the follow-on support of any collaborative or  \r\n\r\n other new weapon/equipment project, as already agreed by EUROGROUP nations in  \r\n\r\n paragraph 9 of the &#187;Principles of Equipment Collaboration&#171;. This  \r\n\r\n follow-on support should include, wherever possible, a most thorough  \r\n\r\n examination of all options for collaboration both in the procurement, holding  \r\n\r\n and distribution of spares and the provision of maintenance facilities (ie  \r\n\r\n servicing, repair and test facilities). A basic and substantial requirement  \r\n\r\n for any area of joint follow-on support is the commitment of all  \r\n\r\n participating countries to maintain wherever possible a uniform configuration  \r\n\r\n of the supported equipment. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. The preparation of follow-on logistic arrangements should normally be  \r\n\r\n undertaken by logisticians of the participating nations, who should consult  \r\n\r\n other appropriate staff or agencies as necessary. Common NATO guidelines,  \r\n\r\n procedures and methods already in existence or being developed should be  \r\n\r\n taken into consideration. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>c. NAMSA was set up by the NATO nations to provide logistic support  \r\n\r\n facilities for common weapons and equipment where this could be undertaken  \r\n\r\n more effectively and economically than could be achived individually by  \r\n\r\n participating nations. Thus consideration should always be given, as an  \r\n\r\n initial option, to the possibility of using the Agency for the logistic  \r\n\r\n support task. If the participating nations decide to offer a task to NAMSA  \r\n\r\n the normal procedure is to request NAMSO (through the Board of Directors) to  \r\n\r\n initiate a feasibility study prior to either the formation of a Weapons  \r\n\r\n System Partnership (WSP) or alternatively, the establishment of a programme.  \r\n\r\n The undermentioned guidelines would also apply in the case of a WSP  \r\n\r\n agreement. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>4.</B> EUROLOG INVESTIGATIONS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The investigation of major weapon systems and projects due to enter  \r\n\r\n service in the years ahead and the comprehensive joint examination of  \r\n\r\n national plans in these fields are essential to ensure that all worhtwhile  \r\n\r\n opportunities for collaboration are taken up. To this end EUROLOG will be  \r\n\r\n assembling lists of new weapon systems to be introduced in the Services of  \r\n\r\n the EUROGROUP countries. These lists will be kept under review periodically.  \r\n\r\n They will be updated by countries end examined jointly at least once a year.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>5.</B> GUIDELINES ON LOGISTICS ASPECTS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. Co-ordination and Direction by participating Nations </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(1) If appropriate a Joint Steering Committee, as a body of senior  \r\n\r\n representatives of the participating countries, should be established to  \r\n\r\n identify at an early stage in the life of a project possible areas for joint  \r\n\r\n logistic support and to co-ordinate logistics with eg training, procurement  \r\n\r\n or post-development. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(2) A Joint Working Group, composed of logistics experts and subordinate  \r\n\r\n to any Joint Steering Committee, should be set up to examine in detail the  \r\n\r\n possible areas, extent and types of logistic co-operation, to sponsor and  \r\n\r\n evaluate any feasibility studies and, subsequently, to implement the  \r\n\r\n agreement reached for logistics support. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. Documentation. A formal document (ie Memorandum of Understanding or WSP  \r\n\r\n agreement) should be drawn up describing and defining the co-ordinated  \r\n\r\n logistic support arrangements mutually agreed by the participants. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>c. Material Requirements. The main object of co-ordinating the material  \r\n\r\n requirements for follow-on logistic support is to achieve the cost benefits  \r\n\r\n which can normally be expected from larger purchases (ie economies of scale)  \r\n\r\n and limiting overall stocks to the minimum by pooling stockholdings wherever  \r\n\r\n possible. Among the factors to be considered are: </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(1) Allocation of responsibility for the procurement of materials,  \r\n\r\n spares, etc (ie to a NATO Agency or to one of the participants); </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(2) A facility to ensure that modification programmes are fully agreed  \r\n\r\n and co-ordinated by all participant nations so as to maintain a common  \r\n\r\n configuration and the ability to interchange main equipments, sub-assemblies  \r\n\r\n and modules between national weapon systems; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(3) Assessment of the range of materials, spares etc required to support  \r\n\r\n the weapon or major equipment concerned at user, maintenance and supply  \r\n\r\n levels; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(4) Naming, identification, classification and numbering in the NATO  \r\n\r\n Codification System of equipments, spares, tools and accessories to be held  \r\n\r\n at every level and/or by each participant; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(5) Identification of the size, location, funding and custodian of the  \r\n\r\n common pool of materials, spares, etc; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(6) The need for an agreed priority system for each participant's  \r\n\r\n requirements and arrangements for exceptional requirements (eg for combat  \r\n\r\n operational requirements and non-scaled items); </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(7) Procedures for distribution of supplies, including timescales for  \r\n\r\n requisition and delivery, methods of handling, transportation and freight,  \r\n\r\n special cases for security and other special requirements; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(8) Planning of follow-on support arrangements and the method of  \r\n\r\n forecasting future requirements, including periodicity of replenishment  \r\n\r\n demands and identification of individual items; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(9) Identification of management and supply information needs and a  \r\n\r\n system for providing and updating them; (eg Data Collection Programme -  \r\n\r\n Evaluation of Unsatisfactory Equipment Reports (UER) - Evaluation of  \r\n\r\n Unsatisfactory Improvement Reports (UIR)); </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(10) Exchange of management and supply information and of engineering  \r\n\r\n information affecting supply; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(11) Disposal of excess or obsolete stocks; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(12) Accounting procedures; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(13) Required testing equipment, inspection facilities and tools; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(14) Drawing up of a calibration concept, including joint use of  \r\n\r\n facilities; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(15) Demands on preservation and packaging procedures including the  \r\n\r\n examination of the necessity and the scope of re-usable containers; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(16) Achieving a concept for the disposition and supervision of a  \r\n\r\n stockpile circuit for interchangeable articles; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(17) Determination of value standards (especially a definition of high  \r\n\r\n value items). </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>d. Maintenance, Overhaul and Repair. The main object is to establish  \r\n\r\n common or compatible maintenance policies so that engineering support  \r\n\r\n facilities can be fully utilised. Among the factors to be considered are;  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(1) The definition of tasks to be undertaken and their division between  \r\n\r\n central (ie provided by a manufacturer, an agency or one of the participants)  \r\n\r\n and national resources; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(2) Provision of common technical publications, record of approved and/or  \r\n\r\n incorporated modifications, and other supporting documentation; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(3) Estimates of consumption of spares for individual maintenance,  \r\n\r\n overhaul and repair tasks; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(4) Provision of spare parts to support repair lines; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(5) Estimates of costs of maintenance, overhaul and repair; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(6) Training requirements in respect of maintenance, overhaul and repair;  \r\n\r\n</LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(7) Provision of special tools and equipment; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(8) Exchange of information, including systems effectiveness, defects,  \r\n\r\n modifications and improvements. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>e. Inter-changeability. In cases where a uniform configuration cannot be  \r\n\r\n obtained or maintained the participants should agree to the  \r\n\r\n interchangeability of assemblies and other component parts, wherever  \r\n\r\n practicable, so as to maximise cross servicing capabilities and minimise the  \r\n\r\n range of spares to be held centrally. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>f. Quality Assurance. The participants should agree on the level and  \r\n\r\n extent of quality assurance to be adopted for: </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(1) Equipment, spares, tools and accessories provided for the first fits  \r\n\r\n and for common and national stocks; and </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(2) maintenance, overhaul and repair tasks. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>g. Finance. Where support is carried out by NAMSA or another NATO agency  \r\n\r\n the normal arrangements for financing programmes undertaken by that Agency  \r\n\r\n will be followed. In other cases it will be necessary for the participating  \r\n\r\n countries to agree appropriate arrangements for cost sharing. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>6.</B> GENERAL </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>EUROLOG is responsible to the EUROGROUP Ministers for monitoring proposed  \r\n\r\n follow-on logistic arrangements for common weapon systems and major  \r\n\r\n equipments to ensure satisfactory arrangements are being made in each case.  \r\n\r\n These guidelines together with the Statement of Principles of Co-operation in  \r\n\r\n Logistics form a basis for such monitoring and consequent reports to  \r\n\r\n EUROGROUP. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>PRACTICAL PROCEDURE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF COLLABORATIVE FOLLOW-ON LOGISTIC  \r\n\r\n SUPPORT FOR NEW COMMON EQUIPMENTS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> This procedure is for use by national consumer  \r\n\r\n logistic planning staff when considering the follow-on logistic support  \r\n\r\n needed for common weapons systems or major equipments after they enter  \r\n\r\n service. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>2.</B> Its purpose is to enable consumer logistic planning  \r\n\r\n staffs to comply with the EUROGROUP Principles of Co-operation in Logistics  \r\n\r\n by ensuring that all options for collaboration between participating nations  \r\n\r\n on follow-on support arrangements are fully considered during the early  \r\n\r\n phases of a collaborative project. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>3.</B> All EUROGROUP nations have signed the Declaration  \r\n\r\n of Principles on Co-operation in Logistics and EUROLOG nations have issued  \r\n\r\n instructions within their own Ministries which require operational  \r\n\r\n requirement staff and production authorities to advise the appropriate  \r\n\r\n consumer logistic planning staff as soon as it is decided that new or  \r\n\r\n replacement equipment will be developed as a collaborative project and to  \r\n\r\n liaise with them in the development of collaborative follow-on support  \r\n\r\n arrangements through of the equipment development. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>4.</B> It is envisaged that the consumer logistic staff  \r\n\r\n will need to be involved from the beginning of the Pre-Concept/Staff Target  \r\n\r\n Development Phase through to the Acquisition/Procurement Phase. This  \r\n\r\n procedure does not extend to the In Service Phase, since it is assumed that  \r\n\r\n logistic support planning will by then be largely completed and subject to  \r\n\r\n normal management action. The checks to be made at each phase are set out  \r\n\r\n below. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5. Staff Target Development Phase </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. Receive notification from Operational Requirements Staff or production  \r\n\r\n authorities that the weapon or equipment is likely to be the subject of a  \r\n\r\n collaborative project. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. Ascertain </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(1) which countries are likely to participate in the project; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(2) whether there is any information as to the likely extent of  \r\n\r\n collaboration on production eg will the weapon be procured from a single  \r\n\r\n source or be the subject of co-production arrangements? </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>c. Consider to the extent possible at this stage the type and probable  \r\n\r\n extent of logistic support required and whether any special storage or  \r\n\r\n maintenance facilities are likely to be required. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>d. Consider whether there are any existing collaborative support  \r\n\r\n arrangements in force for the weapon being replaced or for similar weapons in  \r\n\r\n use by the participating nations and whether these could form the basis for  \r\n\r\n the planning of collaborative support for the new weapon. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>e. Consider to the extent possible at this stage whether NAMSA might be  \r\n\r\n able to provide support facilities and, if not, whether responsibility for  \r\n\r\n certain aspects of support eg configuration control, procurement of  \r\n\r\n materials, maintenance etc could be allocated to one of the participants.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>f. If a MOU is to be drafted at this stage endeavour to ensure that it is  \r\n\r\n worded so as not to close any options for later collaboration on follow-on  \r\n\r\n support and, that, if possible, it includes some undertaking to require  \r\n\r\n participants to consider prospects for collaborative support during the Staff  \r\n\r\n Requirement Development Phase. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>g. Advise the Operational Requirements Staff or Production authorities  \r\n\r\n involved of any views which have been formed about prospects for  \r\n\r\n collaborative support in the light of the above preliminary analysis. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6. Staff Reguirement Development Phase </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. Receive copy of Draft Staff Target and any MOU which may have been  \r\n\r\n signed during the Staff Target Development Phase. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. If not already done, establish liaison with the national member of the  \r\n\r\n Project Group for the equipment concerned. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>c. Consider whether and when it would be appropriate to set up a Joint  \r\n\r\n Steering Committee (para 5a of EUROLOG Guidelimes) and make recommendations  \r\n\r\n accordingly to the Project Group. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>d. Receive copies of the initial draft of systems specifications and  \r\n\r\n ensure that the views of consumer logistic authorities on design features  \r\n\r\n which will affect follow-on support arrangements eg reliability and  \r\n\r\n maintainability, are taken into account in the drafting of these  \r\n\r\n specifications. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>e. If it is decided to negotiate co-production, or licensing agreements  \r\n\r\n during this phase endeavour to ensure that no options for the development of  \r\n\r\n collaborative support are closed; this includes assessing what negotiations  \r\n\r\n are required over intellectual property rights. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>f. Commence planning for standardization of maintenance and supply support  \r\n\r\n in accordance with para 5c, d and e of the EUROLOG guidelines. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>g. Endeavour to ensure that follow-on support arrangements, particularly  \r\n\r\n procurement storage and distribution of spares, arrangements for maintenance  \r\n\r\n and repair and configuration control, are included in any MOU for the system  \r\n\r\n development phase which may be drafted at this stage. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7. System Development Phase </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. Receive copy of the agreed Staff Requirement and any further MOU which  \r\n\r\n may have been signed during the Staff Requirement Development Phase. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. If not already set up under 5c above, consider whether a Joint Steering  \r\n\r\n Committee or Joint Working Group should be set up to examine in detail the  \r\n\r\n possible areas, extent and types of logistic co-operation (para 5a of EUROLOG  \r\n\r\n Guidelines). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>c. Give support to the setting up by the project management authority of a  \r\n\r\n joint common configuration management system which would help to maximise the  \r\n\r\n benefit to be obtained from collaborative support arrangements. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>d. Continue the consideration and development of options for collaborative  \r\n\r\n support on which action was started under the previous phase in accordance  \r\n\r\n with para 5 of the EUROLOG Guidelines and in particular consider </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(1) Allocation of responsibility for procurement of materials. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(2) Estblishing common or compatible maintenance policies, </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(3) The possibility of setting up common calibration, maintenance or  \r\n\r\n repair facilities. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>using the facilities of NAMSA or one of the participants. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>8. Acquisition/Procurement Phase </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>a. Finalise planning for logistic follow-on support and draw up an MOU or  \r\n\r\n other formal document defining the co-ordinated logistic support arrangements  \r\n\r\n mutually agreed. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>b. Complete and implement the logistic plan prior to start of In- Service  \r\n\r\n Phase. </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV><div class=\"bjelke\">Officielle noter</div><DIV CLASS=PARA ID=\"NOTER\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>(* 1) EUROLOG, a specialist subgroup of Eurogroup, has the following  \r\n\r\n membership: Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy,  \r\n\r\n Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, United Kingdom. </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV>",
