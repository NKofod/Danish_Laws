Where appropriate, consideration should  \r\n\r\n be given to preventing the build-up of sludge on access platforms and  \r\n\r\n horizontal structures in general by suitable design of tank structure and  \r\n\r\n positioning of washing machines. Sludge accumulation on the tank bottom  \r\n\r\n should be controlled by an efficient tank draining system. No personnel  \r\n\r\n should enter any cargo tank without a suitable breathing apparatus before the  \r\n\r\n air in the tank has been tested by a responsible officer using an approved  \r\n\r\n gas measuring device and found to be free of gas, containing sufficient  \r\n\r\n oxygen and safe for inspection or work. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>An adequate supply of fresh air is to be available for all men working  \r\n\r\n within a tank having due regard to the nature and location of the work. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>ACCESS TO TANKS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> (a) Tanks, and subdivisions of tanks, having  \r\n\r\n lengths of 35 metres and above should be fitted with at least two access  \r\n\r\n hatchways and ladders, as far apart as praticable longitudinally. </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) Tanks less than 35 metres in length should be served by at least one  \r\n\r\n access hatchway and ladder. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(c) The dimensions of any access hatchway should be sufficient to allow a  \r\n\r\n person wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus to ascend or descend the  \r\n\r\n ladder without obstruction and also to provide a clear opening to facilitate  \r\n\r\n the hoisting of an injured person from the bottom of the tank.

Passageways in  \r\n\r\n the tanks should have a minimum width of 600 mm considering the requirement  \r\n\r\n for the possibility of carrying an unconscious person. Elevated passageways  \r\n\r\n should be provided with guard rails over their entire length. Where guard  \r\n\r\n rails are provided on one side only, footrails should be fitted on the  \r\n\r\n opposite side. Shelves and platforms forming a part of the access to the  \r\n\r\n tanks should be of non-skid construction where practicable and be fitted with  \r\n\r\n guard rails.

Resting platforms of adequate dimensions should be provided. </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) Ladders and handrails should be constructed of steel of adequate  \r\n\r\n strength and stiffness and securely attached to the tank structure by stays.  \r\n\r\n The method of support and length of stay should be such that vibration is  \r\n\r\n reduced to a practical minimum. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(c) Provision should be made for maintaining the structural strength of  \r\n\r\n the ladders and railings taking into account the corrosive effect of the  \r\n\r\n cargo. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(d) The width of ladders between stringers should not be less than 400  \r\n\r\n mm. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(e) The treads should be equally spaced at a distance apart measured  \r\n\r\n vertically not exceeding 300 mm. They should be formed of two square steel  \r\n\r\n bars of not less than 22 mm by 22 mm in section fitted to form a horizontal  \r\n\r\n step with the edges pointing upward, or of equivalent construction. The  \r\n\r\n treads should be carried througt the side stringers and attached thereto by  \r\n\r\n double continuous welding. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(f) All sloping ladders should be provided with handrails of substantial  \r\n\r\n construction on both sides fitted at a convenient distance above the treads.  \r\n\r\n</LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>RESCUE AND EVACUATION ARRANGEMENTS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>4.</B> (a) For fast evacuation of injured personnel aut of  \r\n\r\n a tank, the following equipment should be provided: </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(i) a portable davit with facility for manual operation of ligthweight  \r\n\r\n construction, suitable for securely positioning over tank access; </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(ii) a cage or suitable stretcher fitted with guidelines at the lower  \r\n\r\n end. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) All access openings to the tank should be opened up and the stretcher  \r\n\r\n and hoist should be positioned so as to be readily available before the tank  \r\n\r\n is entered. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>Annex II </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Recommendation on safe, access to and working in large cargo holds of bulk  \r\n\r\n carriers </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Safe access to cargo holds can only be provied on the assumption that  \r\n\r\n adequate ventilation of the holds is provided for the protection of personnel  \r\n\r\n prior to their entry. Consideration should be given to preventing the  \r\n\r\n accumulation of hazardous or noxious vapours in the holds by appropriate  \r\n\r\n ventilation. No personnel should enter a hold that has been battened down for  \r\n\r\n a long time or poorly ventilated before the oxygen content of the air in the  \r\n\r\n hold has been observed by a responsible officer using an oxygen meter or  \r\n\r\n equivalent device and found to be safe for inspection or work. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>An adequate supply of fresh air is to be available for all men working  \r\n\r\n within the cargo hold having due regard to the nature and location of the  \r\n\r\n work. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>ACCESS TO CARGO HOLDS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> (a) If separate hatches are used as access to the  \r\n\r\n ladders required by paragraph 2, each hatch should have a clear opening of at  \r\n\r\n least 600 mm x 600 mm. </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) When the access to the cargo hold is arranged through the cargo  \r\n\r\n hatch, the top of the ladder should be placed as close as possible to the  \r\n\r\n hatch coaming. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(c) Accesses and ladders should be so arranged that personnel equipped  \r\n\r\n with self-contained breathing apparatus may readily enter and leave the cargo  \r\n\r\n hold. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(d) Access hatch coamings having a height greater than 900 mm should also  \r\n\r\n have steps on the outside in conjunction with cargo hold ladders. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>ACCESS WITHIN CARGO HOLDS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>2.</B> (a) Each cargo hold should be provided with at  \r\n\r\n least two ladders as far apart as practicable longitudinally. If possible  \r\n\r\n these ladders should be arranged diagonally, e.g. one ladder near the forward  \r\n\r\n bulkhead on the port side, the other one near the aft bulkhead on the  \r\n\r\n starboard side, from the ships centreline. </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) Ladders should be so designed and arranged that the risk of damage  \r\n\r\n from the cargo handling gear is minimized. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(c) Vertical ladders may be permitted provided they are arranged above  \r\n\r\n each other in line with other ladders to which they form access and resting  \r\n\r\n positions are provided at not more than 9 metres apart. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(d) Tunnels passing through cargo holds should be equipped with ladders  \r\n\r\n or steps at each end of the hold so that personnel may easily get across such  \r\n\r\n tunnels. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(e) Where it may be necessary for work to be carried out within a cargo  \r\n\r\n hold preparatory to loading, consideration should be given to suitable  \r\n\r\n arrangements for the safe handling of portable staging or movable platforms.  \r\n\r\n</LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>CONSTRUCTION OF LADDERS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>3.</B> In general, the design and construction of fixed  \r\n\r\n ladders should be in conformity with the requirements described in Proposed  \r\n\r\n Recommendation on Safe Access to and Working in Large Tanks. However,  \r\n\r\n arrangements and strength of ladders should be suitable for the types of  \r\n\r\n cargo likely to be carried. In particular, having regard to the construction  \r\n\r\n of the hold, and the nature of the cargoes carried, vertical ladders may be  \r\n\r\n acceptable in bulk and combined carriers. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>RESCUE AND EVACUATION ARRANGEMENTS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>4.</B> Equipment as specified in paragraph 4 of Proposed  \r\n\r\n Recommendation on Safe Access to and Working in Large Tanks should be  \r\n\r\n provided for the evacuation of injured personnel from cargo holds. </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV><div class=\"bjelke\">Officielle noter</div><DIV CLASS=PARA ID=\"NOTER\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Ingen </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV>",
