However, in recent years there has been a marked development in the  \r\n\r\n variety of bulk cargoes carried by sea and they now constitute a significant  \r\n\r\n proportion of international seaborne trade. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Milliones of tonnes of these cargoes - coals, concentrates, grains,  \r\n\r\n fertilizers, animal foodstuffs, minerals and ores - are shipped in bulk every  \r\n\r\n year across the oceans of the world. While the vast majority of these  \r\n\r\n shipments are made without incident there have unfortunately been a number of  \r\n\r\n serious casualties which resulted not only in the loss of the ship but also  \r\n\r\n in loss of life. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The problems involved in the carriage of bulk cargoes were recognized by  \r\n\r\n the delegates to the 1960 International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea  \r\n\r\n but at that time it was not possible to frame detailed requirements except  \r\n\r\n for the carriage of grain cargoes. The Conference did recommend, however, in  \r\n\r\n paragraph 55 of Annex D to the Convention, that an internationally acceptable  \r\n\r\n code of safe practice for the shipment of bulk cargoes should be drawn up  \r\n\r\n under the sponsorship of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative  \r\n\r\n Organization (IMCO). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>This work was undertaken by the Organization's Sub-Committee on Containers  \r\n\r\n and Cargoes and four editions of the Code have been produced, the first one  \r\n\r\n appearing in 1965. The Code is a recommended guide for the Administrations,  \r\n\r\n shipowners, shippers and masters on the standards to be applied in the safe  \r\n\r\n stowage and shipment of solid bulk cargoes excluding grain which is dealt  \r\n\r\n with under separate rules. The Code includes general advice on the procedures  \r\n\r\n to be followed whenever bulk cargoes are to be shipped, a description of the  \r\n\r\n hazards associated with certain cargoes, lists of typical products currently  \r\n\r\n shipped in bulk and details of recommended test procedures to determine  \r\n\r\n various characteristics of bulk cargo materials. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>It should be carefully noted, however, that the list of products appearing  \r\n\r\n in Appendices A, B and C to the Code is by no means exhaustive and the  \r\n\r\n physical properties attributed to them are intended only for guidance.  \r\n\r\n Consequently, before loading any bulk cargo it is essential to ascertain -  \r\n\r\n normally from the shipper - the current physical and chemical properties of  \r\n\r\n the cargo. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Since valuable information leading to improvements in this Code may be  \r\n\r\n obtained from voyage reports it is recommended that masters should be  \r\n\r\n encouraged to notify their Administrations of the behaviour of various types  \r\n\r\n of bulk cargoes and, in particular, to report the circumstances of any  \r\n\r\n incidents involving such cargoes. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>CONTENTS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Foreword </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Introduction </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 1 - Definitions </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 2 - General precautions </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Cargo distribution </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Loading and unloading </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 3 - Trimming procedures </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Bulk cargoes having an angle of repose less than or equal to 35 degrees  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Bulk cargoes having an angle of repose greater than 35 degrees </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 4 - Safety of personnel </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>General requirements </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Poisoning and asphyxiation hazards </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Health hazards due to dust </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Flammable(* 1) atmosphere </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Ventilation systems </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 5 - Methods of determining the angle of repose </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 6 - Cargoes which may liquefy </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Properties, characteristics and hazards </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Precautions </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 7 - The assessment of acceptability of consignments for safe  \r\n\r\n shipment </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The provision of information </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Certificates of test </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Sampling procedures </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Frequency of sampling and testing for &#187;flow moisture point&#171;

</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 giving guidance on the procedures to be adopted when the shipment of  \r\n\r\n bulk cargoes is contemplated; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 listing typical products currently shipped in bulk together with advice  \r\n\r\n on their properties and handling; and </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.4 describing test procedures to be employed to determine various  \r\n\r\n characteristics of the bulk cargo materials. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2 Definitions of the terms used throughout the Code are given in Section  \r\n\r\n 1. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3 In general the hazards associated with the shipment of bulk cargoes may  \r\n\r\n be considered as falling into the following categories: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 Structural damage due to improper distribution of the cargo </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Advice on this subject will be found in Section 2 and Appendix C. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 Loss or reduction of stability during a voyage </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>This usually results from: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2.1 A shift of cargo in heavy weather due to the cargo having been  \r\n\r\n inadequately trimmed or improperly distributed; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>(Advice on this subject will be found in Sections 2, 3 and 5 and in  \r\n\r\n Appendices C and D.2) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2.2 Cargoes liquefying under the stimulus of vibration and motion of a  \r\n\r\n ship in a seaway and then sliding or flowing to one side of the cargo hold.  \r\n\r\n Such cargoes are normally finely grained materials, including fine coal,  \r\n\r\n whice are shipped in a damp condition; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>(Advice on this subject will be found in Section 6 and 8 and Appendices A  \r\n\r\n and D.1) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 Chemical reactions (e.g. emission of toxic or explosive gases,  \r\n\r\n spontaneous combustion or severe corrosive effects). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Advice on these subjects will be found in Sections 4, 9 and 10 and  \r\n\r\n Appendices B and D.4. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4 Unless the physical and/or chemical properties of the material presented  \r\n\r\n for shipment are available it will be difficult to determine what  \r\n\r\n precautions, if any, should be taken to ensure safe shipment. It is therefore  \r\n\r\n essential that the shipper should provide adequate information about the  \r\n\r\n cargo to be shipped. Advice on this subject will be found in Section 7. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5 The need for all personnel involved to exercise great care in  \r\n\r\n preparation for and during loading or unloading bulk cargoes and in  \r\n\r\n particular when entering spaces which may be deficient in oxygen, or which  \r\n\r\n may contain toxic gases, is given special mention in Section 4. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6 Lists of typical products currently shipped in bulk, together with  \r\n\r\n advice on their properties and methods of handling, are given in Appendices  \r\n\r\n A, B and C. It is emphasized however that these lists are not exhaustive and  \r\n\r\n that the properties attributed to the products are given only for guidance.  \r\n\r\n Consequently, before loading it is essential to obtain currently valid  \r\n\r\n information on the physical and chemical properties of the products presented  \r\n\r\n for shipment. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7 Details of three test procedures together with advice on methods of  \r\n\r\n sampling to obtain representative samples for test purposes are given in  \r\n\r\n Appendix D. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>8 The three laboratory test procedures described are used for determining  \r\n\r\n the following: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 the moisture content, flow moisture point and transportable moisture  \r\n\r\n limit of materials which may liquefy; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 the angle of repose of granular materials; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 the self-sustaining exothermic decomposition of fertilizers containing  \r\n\r\n nitrates (the trough test). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9 It is strongly recommended that these tests are conducted only by  \r\n\r\n suitable trained personnel. In the cases of 8.1 and 8.2 above, auxiliary  \r\n\r\n check tests which may be employed by the ship's personnel are described.  \r\n\r\n These tests should only be employed in circumstances where the master doubts  \r\n\r\n whether the condition of the cargo is such as to ensure safe shipment. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10 An index listing all the materials mentioned in the Code and indicating  \r\n\r\n the appropriate Appendix in which further information will be found is given  \r\n\r\n in Appendix E. Again, it is emphasized that this list of products is not  \r\n\r\n exhaustive. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>N.B. If a cargo not listed in this Code is offered for bulk carriage the  \r\n\r\n master should consult the appropriate competent authority for further  \r\n\r\n information. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 1 - Definitions </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.1 Angle of repose - is the angle between a horizontal plane and the cone  \r\n\r\n slope of such cargo. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=65661&img=CR24769_1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.2 Cargoes which may liquefy - are cargoes which are subject to moisture  \r\n\r\n migration and subsequent liquefaction if shipped with a moisture content in  \r\n\r\n excess of the transportable moisture limit. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.3 Concentrates - are materials obtained from a natural or by a process  \r\n\r\n of purification by physical or chemical separation and removal of unwanted  \r\n\r\n constituents. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.4 Cargo space - any space in the ship appropriated for the carriage of  \r\n\r\n cargo. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.5 Flow moisture point - is the percentage moisture content (wet weight  \r\n\r\n basis) at which a flow state develops under the prescribed method of test in  \r\n\r\n a representative sample of the material (see Appendix D.1). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.6 Flow state - is a state that occurs when a mass of granular material  \r\n\r\n is saturated with liquid to an extent that under the influence of prevailing  \r\n\r\n external forces such as vibration, impaction or ship's motion, it loses its  \r\n\r\n internal shear strength and behaves as a liquid. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.7 Moisture content - is that portion of a representative sample  \r\n\r\n consisting of water, ice or other liquid(* 2) expressed as a percentage of  \r\n\r\n the total wet weight of that sample. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.8 Moisture migration - is the movement of moisture contained in a bulk  \r\n\r\n cargo by settling and consolidation of the cargo due to vibration and ship's  \r\n\r\n motion. Water is progressively displaced which may result in some portions or  \r\n\r\n all of the bulk cargo developing a flow state. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.9 Representative test sample - is a sample of sufficient quantity for  \r\n\r\n the purpose of testing physical and/or chemical properties of the consignment  \r\n\r\n to meet specified requirements. It should be collected by means of an  \r\n\r\n appropriate systematic sampling procedure. See 7.3. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.10 Shipper - for the purposes of this Code the term &#187;shipper&#171;  \r\n\r\n means any person by whom or in whose name or on whose behalf a contract of  \r\n\r\n carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a carrier, or any person by  \r\n\r\n whom or in whose name or on whose behalf the goods are actually delivered to  \r\n\r\n the carrier in relation to the contract of carriage by sea. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.11 Solid bulk cargo - is any cargo, other than liquid or gas, consisting  \r\n\r\n of a combination of particles, granules or any larger pieces of materials,  \r\n\r\n generally uniform in composition, which is loaded directly into the cargo  \r\n\r\n spaces of a ship without any intermediate form of containment. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.12 Stowage factor - the stowage factor of bulk cargo is the figure which  \r\n\r\n expresses the number of cubic metres which one tonne of cargo will occupy.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.13 Transportable moisture limit - of a cargo which may liquefy,  \r\n\r\n represents the maximum moisture content of that cargo, which is considered  \r\n\r\n safe for carriage in ships not complying with the special provisions of 6.2.2  \r\n\r\n and 6.2.3. It is derived from the flow moisture point (flow table test  \r\n\r\n Appendix D.1) or from data obtained from other test methods approved by the  \r\n\r\n appropriate authority of the port State as being equally reliable. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.14 Trimming - for the purpose of this Code trimming means any levelling  \r\n\r\n of the cargo within a cargo space, either partial or total, by means of  \r\n\r\n loading spouts or chutes, portable machinery, equipment or manual labour.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 2 - General precautions </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1 Cargo distribution </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.1 General </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.1.1 It is very important to ensure that bulk cargoes are properly  \r\n\r\n distributed throughout the ship in order that the structure will never be  \r\n\r\n overstressed and that the ship will have an adequate standard of stability.  \r\n\r\n To do this effecttively however the master needs to be provided, by the  \r\n\r\n shipper, with adequate information about the cargo to be shipped, e.g.  \r\n\r\n stowage factor, history of shifting, any particular problems, etc. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.2 To prevent the structure being overstressed </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.2.1 When loading a high density bulk cargo having a stowage factor of  \r\n\r\n about 0.56 cubic metres per tonne or lower, the loaded conditions are  \r\n\r\n different from those found normally and it is important to pay particular  \r\n\r\n attention to the distribution of weights so as to avoid excessive stresses. A  \r\n\r\n general cargo ship is normally constructed to carry cargoes of about  \r\n\r\n 1.39-1.67 cubic metres per tonne when loaded to full bale cubic and  \r\n\r\n deadweight capacity. Because of the high density of some bulk cargoes, it is  \r\n\r\n possible, by improper distribution of loading, to stress very highly either  \r\n\r\n the structure locally under the load or the entire hull. It is not  \r\n\r\n practicable to set out exact rules for the distribution of loading in all  \r\n\r\n ships since the structural arrangements may vary greatly. It is therefore  \r\n\r\n recommended that the master be provided with sufficiently comprehensive  \r\n\r\n loading information to enable him to arrange the loading aboard his ship so  \r\n\r\n as not to overstress the structure. In general, masters should be guided by  \r\n\r\n the loading information provided in the ship's stability information booklet  \r\n\r\n and by the results obtained by the use of loading calculators, if available.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.2.2 When detailed information is not available for high density bulk  \r\n\r\n cargoes, then the following precautions are recommended: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 the general fore and aft distribution of cargo by weight should not  \r\n\r\n differ appreciably from that found satisfactory for general cargoes; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 the maximum number of tonnes of cargo loaded in any cargo space should  \r\n\r\n not exceed </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>0.9 LBD tonnes (2.1.2.2.2) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>where </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>l = length of the hold in metres </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>B = average breadth of hold in metres </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D = summer load draught in metres. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 where cargo is untrimmed or only partially trimmed the corresponding  \r\n\r\n height of cargo pile peak above the cargo space floor should not exceed </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1.1 x D x stowage factor (2.1.2.2.3) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>where the stowage factor is given in cubic metres per tonne; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.4 if the cargo is trimmed entirely level the maximum number of tonnes of  \r\n\r\n cargo loaded in any lower hold cargo space may be increased by 20 per cent  \r\n\r\n over the amount calculated by formula (2.1.2.2.2), subject however to full  \r\n\r\n compliance with 2.1.2.2.1; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.5 because of the stiffening effect of a shaft tunnel on the ship's  \r\n\r\n bottom, lower hold cargo spaces abaft the machinery space may be loaded  \r\n\r\n somewhat more deeply than provided for in 2.1.2.2.2, 2.1.2.2.3 and 2.1.2.2.4,  \r\n\r\n up to about 10 per cent in excess, provided that such additional loading is  \r\n\r\n consistent with 2.1.2.2.1. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.3 To aid stability </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.3.1 Having regard to Regulation 19(a) of Chapter II-1 of the  \r\n\r\n International Convention for the safety of Life at Sea, 1974, a stability  \r\n\r\n information booklet should be provided aboard all ships which are subject to  \r\n\r\n that Convention. Where bulk cargoes referred to in this Code, and requiring  \r\n\r\n any of the loading and operational precautions specified therein, are to be  \r\n\r\n carried, the information supplied to the master should include all necessary  \r\n\r\n data relative thereto. The master must be able to calculate the stability for  \r\n\r\n the anticipated worst conditions during the voyage as well as that on  \r\n\r\n departure and show that the stability is adequate. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.3.2 In general, high density cargoes should normally be loaded in the  \r\n\r\n lower hold cargo spaces rather that in &#187;tweendeck cargo spaces. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.3.3 When, however, it is necessary to carry high density cargoes in  \r\n\r\n &#187;twenndecks or higher cargo spaces, care must be exercised to ensure  \r\n\r\n that the deck area is not overstressed and that the ship's stability is not  \r\n\r\n reduced below the minimum acceptable level as laid down in the ship's  \r\n\r\n stability information booklet supplied to the master. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.3.4 In transport of high density cargo a particularly careful  \r\n\r\n evaluation should be made of the consequences of sailing with an excessively  \r\n\r\n high GM with consequential violent movement in a seaway. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.1.3.5 Shifting divisions and bins, of adequate strength, should be  \r\n\r\n erected whenever bulk cargoes, which are suspected of readily shifting, are  \r\n\r\n carried in &#187;tweendeck cargo spaces or only partially fill a cargo space.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.2 Loading and unloading </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.2.1 Before loading, the cargo spaces should be inspected and prepared  \r\n\r\n for the particular bulk cargo which it is intended to load. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.2.2 The master should ensure that bilge lines, sounding pipes and other  \r\n\r\n service lines within the cargo space are in good order. Because of the  \r\n\r\n velocity at which some high density bulk cargoes are loaded into the cargo  \r\n\r\n space, special care may be necessary to protect cargo space fittings from  \r\n\r\n damage. For this reason it is also prudent to sound bilges after the  \r\n\r\n completion of loading. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.2.3 Attention is particularly drawn to bilge wells and strainer plates  \r\n\r\n which should be specially prepared to faciliate drainage and to prevent entry  \r\n\r\n of the cargo into the bilge system. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.2.4 The master is advised that precautions should be taken to minimize  \r\n\r\n the extent to which dust may come into contact with the mowing parts of deck  \r\n\r\n machinery and external navigational aids. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2.2.5 Wherever possible, ventilation systems should be shut down or  \r\n\r\n screened and air conditioning systems, if any, placed or recirculation during  \r\n\r\n loading or discharge, in order to minimize the entry of dust into the living  \r\n\r\n quarters or other interior spaces of the ship. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 3 - Trimming procedures </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.1 Bulk cargoes having an angle of repose(* 3) less than or equal to 35  \r\n\r\n degrees </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.1.1 Such cargoes should be trimmed reasonably level and cargo spaces in  \r\n\r\n which they are loaded should be filled as fully as is practicable without  \r\n\r\n resulting in an excessive cargo weight on the supporting bottom structure or  \r\n\r\n deck. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.1.2 Where dry bulk cargoes which flow freely like grain are to be  \r\n\r\n carried, the provisions applicable to the stowage of grain cargoes should be  \r\n\r\n followed. However, account should be taken of the density of the cargo when  \r\n\r\n determining: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 the scantlings and securing arrangements of divisions and bin  \r\n\r\n bulkheads; and </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 the stability effect of free cargo surfaces. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.2 Bulk cargoes having an angle of repose(* 4) greater than 35 degrees  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.2.1 When cargo is loaded only in lower cargo spaces it should be trimmed  \r\n\r\n sufficiently to cover all of the tank top out to the ship's side, and  \r\n\r\n otherwise as necessary in order to reduce the pile peak height and equalize  \r\n\r\n the weight distribution on the bottom structure. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.2.2 Such trimming as is necessary may generally be accomplished by  \r\n\r\n levelling within the hatch square (see 3.2.3) with the remaining cargo sloped  \r\n\r\n approximately uniformly to the lower cargo sides, and to the end bulkheads.  \r\n\r\n Provided that there is no conflict with the 1966 Load Line Convention, an if  \r\n\r\n an excessive peak height does not result, cargo may extend up through the  \r\n\r\n &#187;tweendeck hatchway which should then be left uncovered. In such case,  \r\n\r\n the pile should be sufficiently clear of the hatchway edges so that any  \r\n\r\n possible slide of the pile peak will remain in the cargo space. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.2.3 Notwithstanding the above or the provisions in Section 2, the  \r\n\r\n importance of trimming as an effective means of reducing the possibility of a  \r\n\r\n shift of cargo can never be overstressed. This advice applies especially to  \r\n\r\n smaller ships, i.e. ships of 100 metres in length or less. Consequently the  \r\n\r\n loading of smaller ships requires careful supervision. In such ships the aim  \r\n\r\n should be to distribute the cargo in a manner which eliminates the formation  \r\n\r\n of wide, steeply sloped voids beyond the trimmed surface within the area of  \r\n\r\n the hatch square. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3.2.4 In any ship where it is necessary to load cargo in the  \r\n\r\n &#187;tweendecks, the &#187;tweendeck hatch should be closed. The  \r\n\r\n &#187;tweendeck cargo should be trimmed reasonably level and should either  \r\n\r\n extend from side to side and bulkhead to bulkhead, or should be secured in  \r\n\r\n bins. Because of the reduced stability when cargo is carried in the  \r\n\r\n &#187;tweendecks it is also generally necessary that the cargo in the lower  \r\n\r\n cargo space be trimmed to a greater extent than when cargo is carried only in  \r\n\r\n the lower cargo space. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 4 - Safety of personnel </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.1 General requirements </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.1.1 Prior to, and during, loading, transport and unloading of bulk  \r\n\r\n cargoes, all necessary safety precautions including any appropriate national  \r\n\r\n regulations or requirements should be observed and, in particular, the  \r\n\r\n following recommandations should be taken into account: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 ILO Convention 32 - Convention concerning the Protection against  \r\n\r\n Accidents of Workers Employed in Loading or Unloading Ships (Revised), 1932;  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 ILO Code of Practice - Accident Prevention on board Ship at Sea and in  \r\n\r\n Port, 1978; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 ILO Code of Practice - Safety and Health in Dock Work, 1977. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2 Poisoning and asphyxiation hazards </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.1 Certain bulk cargoes are liable to oxidation which in turn may  \r\n\r\n result in oxygen reduction, emission of toxic fumes and self-heating. Other  \r\n\r\n bulk cargoes may not oxidise but may emit toxic fumes. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.2 It is important therefore that the shipper informs the master prior  \r\n\r\n to loading as to whether chemical hazards exist. The master should also refer  \r\n\r\n to Appendix B and the necessary precautions, especially those pertaining to  \r\n\r\n ventilation, should be taken. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.3 Ship's masters are warned that cargo spaces and adjacent spaces may  \r\n\r\n be depleted in oxygen or may contain toxic or asphyxiating gases. This may  \r\n\r\n happen due to oxidation, other chemical reactions or the evoluation of  \r\n\r\n absorbed gases. An empty cargo space which has remained closed for some time  \r\n\r\n may have insufficient oxygen to support life. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.4 Unless adequate ventilation and air circulation throughout the free  \r\n\r\n space above the cargo have been effected, entry by personnel should not be  \r\n\r\n permitted until tests have been carried out and it has been established that  \r\n\r\n the oxygen content has been restored to normal levels throughout the space  \r\n\r\n and that no toxic gas is present. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.5 Other cargoes may emit toxic gases when wetted. In these cases the  \r\n\r\n ship should be provided with the appropriate gas detection equipment. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.6 It should be noted that a flammable gas detector is suitable only  \r\n\r\n for testing the explosive nature of gas mixtures. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.7 Emergency entry into a cargo space should be undertaken only by  \r\n\r\n trained personnel wearing selfcontained breathing apparatus, and protective  \r\n\r\n clothing if considered necessary, and always under the supervision of a  \r\n\r\n responsible officer. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2.8 In the event of emergency entry into a cargo space, in addition to  \r\n\r\n the requirement in 4.2.4, spare self-contained breathing apparatus, safety  \r\n\r\n belts and safety lines should be readlily available. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.3 Health hazards due to dust </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.3.1 To minimize the chronic risks due to exposure to the dust of certain  \r\n\r\n materials carried in bulk the need for a high standard of personal hygiene of  \r\n\r\n those exposed to the dust cannot be too strongly emphasized. The precautions  \r\n\r\n should include not only the use of appropriate protective clothing and  \r\n\r\n barrier creams when needed but also adequate personal washing and laundering  \r\n\r\n of outher clothing. Althrough these precautions are good standard practice  \r\n\r\n they are particularly relevant for those materials identified as toxic by the  \r\n\r\n Code. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.4 Flammable atmosphere </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.4.1 Dust created by certain cargoes may constitute an explosion hazard,  \r\n\r\n especially while loading, unloading and cleaning. This risk can be minimized  \r\n\r\n at such times by ensuring that ventilation is sufficient to prevent the  \r\n\r\n formation of a dust-laden atmosphere and by hosing down rather than sweeping.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.4.2 Some cargoes may emit flammable gases in sufficient quantities to  \r\n\r\n constitute a fire explosion hazard. Where this is indicated in the entries in  \r\n\r\n Appendix B the cargo spaces and adjacent enclosed spaces should be  \r\n\r\n effectively ventilated at all times. It may be necessary to monitor the  \r\n\r\n atmosphere in such spaces by means of combustible gas indicators. It should  \r\n\r\n be recognized that, in general, combustible gas measuring instrucments are  \r\n\r\n not suitable for checking an atmosphere for the presence of toxic gases. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.5 Ventilation systems </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.5.1 Where cargoes are carried which may emit toxic or flammable gases  \r\n\r\n the cargo spaces should be provided with effective ventilation. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 5 - Methods of determining the angle of repose(* 5) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1 There are various methods in use to determine the angle of repose for  \r\n\r\n bulk materials and several are listed below for information purposes. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1.1 Ores, coals and ore concentrates should be air dried in a loose  \r\n\r\n condition before the angle of repose is determined. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1.2 Tilting box method. This method was developed mainly for laboratory  \r\n\r\n use and is suitable for noncohesive granular materials having a grain size  \r\n\r\n not greater than 10 mm. A full description of the equipment and procedure is  \r\n\r\n given in Appendix D.2.1. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1.3 For use on board ship, or when a tilting box is not available, an  \r\n\r\n auxiliary method for use with non-cohesive granular materials having a grain  \r\n\r\n size not greater than 10 mm is given in Appendix D.2.2. It should be noted  \r\n\r\n however that results thus obtained are generally lower than those obtained by  \r\n\r\n the tilting box method. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1.4 On-site method. This method may be used to determine the angle of  \r\n\r\n repose for all bulk materials when a stockpile of the material to be loaded  \r\n\r\n is available. The angle subtended by the surface of the stockpile and the  \r\n\r\n ground is measured (see Section 1). A minimum of six such measurements should  \r\n\r\n be taken around the circumference of the stockpile and the mean of such  \r\n\r\n measurements will provide the angle of repose. Where a stockpile is not  \r\n\r\n available, a cone of the materials as deposited by grab, truck or similar  \r\n\r\n means may be utilized. It should, however, be recognized that the larger the  \r\n\r\n cone so obtained the more accurately the angle of repose will equate with  \r\n\r\n on-board situation. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.2 Where masters are in doubt as to which method should be, or has been,  \r\n\r\n used, they should consult the port authority for advice. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 6 - Cargoes which may liquefy </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1 Properties, characteristics and hazards </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1.1 Cargoes which may liquefy include concentrates, certain coals and  \r\n\r\n other materials having similar physical properties. Appendix A contains a  \r\n\r\n list of such cargoes which generally consist of a mixture of small particles  \r\n\r\n as contrasted with natural ores which include a considerable percentage of  \r\n\r\n large particles or lumps. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1.2 At a moisture content above that of the transportable moisture limit  \r\n\r\n shift of cargo may accur as a result of liquefaction. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1.3 The major purpose of the sections of this Code dealing with these  \r\n\r\n cargoes is to draw the attention of masters and others to the latent risk of  \r\n\r\n cargo shift and to describe the precautions which are deemed necessary to  \r\n\r\n minimize this risk. Such cargoes may appear to be in a relatively dry  \r\n\r\n granular state when loaded, and yet may contain sufficient moisture to become  \r\n\r\n fluid under the stimulus of compaction and the vibration which occurs during  \r\n\r\n a voyage. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1.4 In the resulting viscous fluid state, cargo may flow to one side of  \r\n\r\n the ship with a roll one way but mot completely return with a roll the other  \r\n\r\n way. Thus, the ship may progressively reach a dangerous heel and capsize.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>+++FIGUR(billede)+++ </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1.5 To prevent subsequent shifting and also to decrease the effects of  \r\n\r\n oxidation when the material has a predisposition to oxidize, these cargoes  \r\n\r\n should be trimmed reasonably level on completion of loading irrespective of  \r\n\r\n the stated angel of repose. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2 Precautions </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.1 General </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.1.1 Ships other than specially constructed or fitted ships (see 6.2.2  \r\n\r\n and 6.2.3) should carry only those cargoes having a moisture content not in  \r\n\r\n excess of the transportable moisture limit as defined in this Code. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.1.2 Cargoes which contain liquids, other than packaged canned goods or  \r\n\r\n the like, should not be stowed in the same cargo space above or adjacent to a  \r\n\r\n consignment of these cargoes. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.1.3 Adequate precautions to prevent liquids entering the cargo space  \r\n\r\n in which these cargoes are stowed should be maintained during the voyage.  \r\n\r\n Such precautions are of paramount importance in the case of some of these  \r\n\r\n cargoes where contact with sea water could lead to serious problems or  \r\n\r\n corrosion to either the hull or machinery items. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.1.4 Masters are cautioned of the possible danger in using water to  \r\n\r\n cool a shipment of these cargoes while the ship is at sea since the admission  \r\n\r\n of water in quantity may well bring the moisture content of these cargoes to  \r\n\r\n a flow state. Water is most effectively applied in the form of a spray. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.2 Specially fitted cargo ships </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.2.1 Cargoes having a moisture content in excess of the transportable  \r\n\r\n moisture limit may be carried in cargo ships which are fitted with specially  \r\n\r\n designed portable divisions to confine any shift of cargo to an acceptable  \r\n\r\n limit. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.2.2 The design and positioning of such special arrangements must  \r\n\r\n adequately provide for not only the restraint of the immense forces generated  \r\n\r\n by the flow movement of high density bulk cargoes, but also the need to  \r\n\r\n reduce to an acceptable safe level the potential heeling moments arising out  \r\n\r\n of a cargo flow transversely across the cargo space. Divisions provided to  \r\n\r\n meet these requirements should not be constructed of wood. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.2 .3 It may also be necessary for elements of the ship's structure  \r\n\r\n bounding such cargo to be strengthened. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.2.4 The plan of special arrangements deemed necessary and details of  \r\n\r\n the stability conditions on which the design has been based should have been  \r\n\r\n approved by the Administration of the country of the ship's registry. In such  \r\n\r\n cases the ship concerned should carry evidence of approval by its  \r\n\r\n Administration. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.3 Specially constructed cargo ships </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2.3.1 Cargoes having a moisture content in excess of the transportable  \r\n\r\n moisture limit may be carried in specially constructed cargo ships which have  \r\n\r\n permanent structural boundaries, so arranged as to confine any shift of cargo  \r\n\r\n to an acceptable limit.

Furthermore the shipper should provide the ship's master with the  \r\n\r\n appropriate certificates of test, as applicable for a given cargo. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.2 Certificates of test </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.2.1 A certificate or certificates stating the relevant characteristic of  \r\n\r\n the material to be loaded should be provided to the master at the loading  \r\n\r\n point. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.2.2 Certificates stating the transportable moisture limits should  \r\n\r\n contain, or be accompanied, by a statement by the shipper that the moisture  \r\n\r\n content specified in the certificate of moisture content is, to the best of  \r\n\r\n his knowledge and belief, the average moisture content of the cargo at the  \r\n\r\n time the certificate is present to the master. When cargo is to be loaded  \r\n\r\n into more than one cargo space of a ship the certificate of moisture content  \r\n\r\n should certify the moisture content of each type of finely grained material  \r\n\r\n loaded into each cargo space. However, if sampling according to the  \r\n\r\n procedures recommended in this Code indicates that the moisture content is  \r\n\r\n uniform throughout the consignment, then one certificate of average moisture  \r\n\r\n content for all cargo spaces should be acceptable. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.2.3 Where certification is required by Appendix B for materials  \r\n\r\n possessing chemical hazards, the certificate should contain or be accompanied  \r\n\r\n by a statement from the shipper that the chemical characteristics of the  \r\n\r\n material are, to the best of his knowledge, those existing at the time of the  \r\n\r\n ship's loading. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.3 Sampling procedures </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.3.1 It is evident that any physical property tests on the bulk cargo  \r\n\r\n material will be meaningless unless they are conducted on test samples which  \r\n\r\n are established as truly representative of the consignment, prior to loading.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.3.2 Sampling should be conducted only by persons who have been suitably  \r\n\r\n trained in sampling procedures and who are under the supervision of somemore  \r\n\r\n who is fully aware of the properties of the material and also the applicable  \r\n\r\n principles and practices of sampling. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.3.3 Prior to taking samples, and within the limits of practicability, a  \r\n\r\n visual inspection of the material which is to form the ship's cargo should be  \r\n\r\n carried out. Any substantial portions of material which appear to be  \r\n\r\n contaminated or significantly different in characteristics or moisture  \r\n\r\n content from the bulk of the consignment should be sampled and analysed  \r\n\r\n separately. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Depending upon the results obtained in these tests it may be necessary to  \r\n\r\n reject those particular portions as unfit for shipment. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.3.4 Representative samples should be obtained by employing techniques  \r\n\r\n which take the following factors into account: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 the type of material; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 the particle size distribution; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 composition of the material and its variability; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.4 the manner in which the material is stored, in stockpiles, rail wagons  \r\n\r\n or other containers, and transferred or loaded by material handling systems  \r\n\r\n such as conveyors, loading chutes, crane grabs, etc.; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.5 the characteristics which have to be determined: moisture content, flow  \r\n\r\n moisture point, bulk density/stowage factor, angle of repose, etc.; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.6 variations in moisture distribution throughout the consignment which  \r\n\r\n may occur due to weather conditions, natural drainage, e.g. to lower levels  \r\n\r\n of stockpiles or containers, or other forms of moisture migration. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.3.5 Throughout sampling procedures, the utmost care should be taken to  \r\n\r\n prevent changes in quality and characteristics.

However, where the composition or characteristics are  \r\n\r\n variable for any reason, more frequent testing is necessary. In such cases  \r\n\r\n testing once every three months and possibly more frequently is essential as  \r\n\r\n such variations could have significant effect of the value of the flow  \r\n\r\n moisture point.

Furthermore, whenever there has been  \r\n\r\n significant rain or snow between the time of testing and loading, check test  \r\n\r\n should be conducted to ensure that the material is still in a safe state to  \r\n\r\n load. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.5 Standardized sampling procedures </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n ISO 3081-1973             - Iron ores - Increment sampling - Manual  \r\n\r\n                                                                method  \r\n\r\n ISO 1988-1975             - Hard coal - Sampling  \r\n\r\n ASTM D 2234               - The American Standard Procedures for  \r\n\r\n                                                         Sampling Coal  \r\n\r\n B.S. 1017                 - Part 1 - The British Standard for  \r\n\r\n                                                         Sampling Coal  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Canadian Standard Sampling Procedure for Concentrate Stockpiles </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The European Communities Method of Sampling for the Comtrol of the </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n                                                           Fertilizers  \r\n\r\n J.I.S.

Other methods for direct  \r\n\r\n measurements of moisture content approved by the approiate authority for  \r\n\r\n specific cargoes may be used for this purpose.

Take the can in one hand and bring it down sharply to  \r\n\r\n strike a hard surface such as a solid table from a height of about 0.2 m.  \r\n\r\n Repeat the procedure 25 times at one or two second intervals. Examine the  \r\n\r\n surface for free moisture or fluid conditions. If free moisture or a fluid  \r\n\r\n condition appears, arrangements should be made to have additional laboratory  \r\n\r\n tests on the cargo conducted before it is accepted for loading. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>8.5 The recommended test procedures given in Appendix D reflect the  \r\n\r\n majority opinion of those countries participating in its preparation.  \r\n\r\n However, other methods which have been approved by the appropriate  \r\n\r\n authorities as being equally reliable may be used. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 9 - Materials possessing chemical hazards: description of hazards  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.1 General </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Appendix B contains the list of materials currently carried in bulk which,  \r\n\r\n because of their chemical nature or properties, can present a hazard during  \r\n\r\n transport. Some of these materials are classified as dangerous goods in the  \r\n\r\n IMDG Code; also included are other cargoes which, when carried in bulk, may  \r\n\r\n give rise to a hazardous situation. It should be carefully noted, however,  \r\n\r\n that this list of materials is not exhaustive and that the hazardous  \r\n\r\n properties attributed to them are for guidance only. Consequently, whenever  \r\n\r\n the shipment of a bulk cargo is contemplated, it is essential to obtain  \r\n\r\n currently valid information about its potential hazards prior to loading.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.2 Classes of hazard </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The classes of hazard likely to be presented by the cargoes listed in  \r\n\r\n Appendix B as given in the 1974 SOLAS Convention, Chapter VII, are listed  \r\n\r\n below together with notes which will assist in the interpretation of these  \r\n\r\n definitions. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 Class 4.1 Flammable(* 6) solids </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess the common property of being easily  \r\n\r\n ignited by external sources, such as sparks or flame, and of being readily  \r\n\r\n combustible. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 Class 4.2 Flammable solids, or substances, liable to spontaneous  \r\n\r\n combustion </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess the common property of being liable  \r\n\r\n spontaneously to heat and to ignite. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 Class 4.3 Flammable solids, or substances which, in contact with water,  \r\n\r\n emit flammable gases </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess the common property, when in contact with  \r\n\r\n water, of evolving flammable gases. In some cases these gases are liable to  \r\n\r\n spontaneous ignition. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.4 Class 5.1 Oxidizing substances </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials in this Class while in themselves not necessarily combustible  \r\n\r\n may, generally by yielding oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of  \r\n\r\n other marterial (and as a result may stimulate combustion, and increase the  \r\n\r\n violence of a (fire). Neither sealing off the cargo space nor the use of  \r\n\r\n steam, CO2 or other inert gas extinguishers is therefore likely to be  \r\n\r\n effective against fire. The prompt use of large quantities of water is  \r\n\r\n probably the most effective means of controlling fire in these cargoes. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.5 Class 6.1 Poisonous (toxic) substances </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess the common property of being liable to  \r\n\r\n cause death or serious injury to human health if swallowed, inhaled or by  \r\n\r\n skin contact. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.6 Class 7 Radioactive substances </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess the common property of spontaneously  \r\n\r\n emitting significant radiation and of which the specific activity is greater  \r\n\r\n than 0.002 microcuries per gram. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.7 Class 8 Corrosives </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess in their original state the common  \r\n\r\n property of being able more or less severely to damage living tissues, and  \r\n\r\n may also cause damage to other cargo or the ship by corrosion. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.8 Class 9 Miscellaneous dangerous substances, that is any other substance  \r\n\r\n which experimence has shown, or may show, to be of such a dangerous character  \r\n\r\n that the provisions of Chapter VII of the 1974 SOLAS Convention should apply  \r\n\r\n to it. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this Class possess hazards which cannot properly be brought  \r\n\r\n under the other classes listed above. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.3 Materials hazardous only in bulk (MHB) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials of this type while they may not necessarily be listed in the  \r\n\r\n IMDG Code may, when carried in bulk, present a sufficient hazard to require  \r\n\r\n some degree of caution. For example, materials which reduce the oxygen  \r\n\r\n content of a cargo space and those which are prone to self-heating are  \r\n\r\n regarded as belonging to this group. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Section 10 - Materials possessing chemical hazards </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.1 Identification </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.1.1 The majority of such materials are included in Appendix B and their  \r\n\r\n hazard class will be listed as described in Section 9 (i.e. IMCO Class or  \r\n\r\n &#187;MHB&#171; - materials hazardous only in bulk). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.1.2 The non-appearance of a material in Appendix B should not be taken  \r\n\r\n as an absolute guarantee of its non-hazarderous nature. Current valid  \r\n\r\n information should always be obtained prior to loading. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.2 Segregation </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.2.1 Stowage of such materials should be so arranged at all times that  \r\n\r\n dangerous or hazardous materials carried in bulk are kept segregated from  \r\n\r\n dangerous goods carried in packaged or unitized form in accordance with the  \r\n\r\n information given under their individual entries and in the case of  \r\n\r\n explosives as shown in the explosives segregation table. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.2.2 When two or more different incompatible bulk commodities possessing  \r\n\r\n chemical hazards are to be carried, the segregation between them shall be at  \r\n\r\n least equivalent to that described under 10.4.2 &#187;separated from&#171;.  \r\n\r\n Segregation is not necessary between different grades of the same material.  \r\n\r\n However, where different grades are carried in the same cargo space the most  \r\n\r\n stringent stowage provisions applicable to any of the different grades shall  \r\n\r\n apply to all. When loading different solid bulk materials which are  \r\n\r\n incompatible, such cargoes should not be loaded simultaneously. Similarly,  \r\n\r\n toxic bulk materials and bulk food and feedstuffs should not be loaded  \r\n\r\n simultaneously. Upon completion of loading one such material the hatch covers  \r\n\r\n of every cargo space containing it should be closed and the decks cleared of  \r\n\r\n residues before loading of other materials is recommended. When unloading,  \r\n\r\n the same procedures should be followed. Such cleaning is essential where bulk  \r\n\r\n flammable materials and bulk materials of Class 5.1 are carried, to prevent  \r\n\r\n combustion. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.2.3 The determination of the incompatibility of bulk commodities should  \r\n\r\n be made by the competent authority. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.2.4 Boundaries, e.g. bulkheads or decks used for the segregation of  \r\n\r\n bulk dangerous cargoes from other dangerous cargoes, in either bulk or  \r\n\r\n packaged form, need be resistant to the passage of the fire and liquid only  \r\n\r\n where indicated under individual entries. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.3 Cargo distribution and trimming </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.3.1 The provisions of Section 2, 3 and 4 of this Code relating to cargo  \r\n\r\n distribution, trimming and personnel safety apply as much to cargoes dealt  \r\n\r\n with under this section as to any others. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.4 Segregation table to be used when loading bulk cargoes possessing  \r\n\r\n chemical hazards and explosives in packaged form </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n  Bulk materials                Explosives in packaged form  \r\n\r\n    possessing         1.1-1.5        1.2          1.3          1.4  \r\n\r\n chemical hazards    Explosives   Explosives   Explosives   Explosives  \r\n\r\n        4.1               4            4            3            2  \r\n\r\n        4.2               4            4            3            2  \r\n\r\n        4.3               4            4            4            2  \r\n\r\n        5.1               4            4            4            2  \r\n\r\n        6.1               2            2            2            2  \r\n\r\n        7                 2            2            2            2  \r\n\r\n        8                 4            4            2            2  \r\n\r\n        9                 2            2            2            2  \r\n\r\n        MHB               2            2            2            2  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P>Appendix B </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Replace page 40 by the followings pages. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.4.1 Explanation of the segregation table </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Numbers in the above table relate to the following terms, as definied in  \r\n\r\n sub-section 15.8 of the general introduction to the IMDG Code. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.4.2 &#187;Separated from:&#187; (2) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>In different cargo spaces when stowed under deck.

This will  \r\n\r\n range from approximately 2 kg for coal to 3 kg for mineral concentrates. It  \r\n\r\n should be collected as a representative sample of the cargo being shipped.  \r\n\r\n Experience has shown that more accurate test results will be obtained by  \r\n\r\n ensuring that the moisture content of the test sample is increased rather  \r\n\r\n than decreased towards the flow moisture point. Consequently it is  \r\n\r\n recommended that a preliminary flow moisture test should be conducted,  \r\n\r\n generally in accordance with the following, to indicate the condition of the  \r\n\r\n test sample, i.e. the quantity of water and the rate at which it has to be  \r\n\r\n added or whether the sample should be air dried to reduce its moisture  \r\n\r\n content before commencing the main flow moisture test. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.1.4.1 Preparation of the test sample </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The representative sample of test material is placed in the mixing bowl  \r\n\r\n and thoroughly mixed. Three sub-samples (A, B and C) are removed from the  \r\n\r\n mixing bowl as follows: About one fifth of the sample (A) shall be  \r\n\r\n immediately weighed and placed in the drying oven to determine the moisture  \r\n\r\n content of the sample &#187;as received&#171;. Two further sub-samples, each  \r\n\r\n of about two fifths of the gross weight shall then be taken, one (B) for the  \r\n\r\n preliminary flow moisture point test and the other (C) for the main flow  \r\n\r\n moisture point determination. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Having completed the preliminary flow moisture point test, the sample for  \r\n\r\n the main test is adjusted to the required level of moisture content below the  \r\n\r\n flow point. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 Filling the mould. The mould is placed on the centre of the flow table  \r\n\r\n and filled in three stages with the material from the mixing bowl. The first  \r\n\r\n charge, after tamping, should aim to fill the mould to approximately one  \r\n\r\n third of its depth. The quantity of sample required to achieve this will vary  \r\n\r\n from one material to another, but can readily be established after some  \r\n\r\n experience has been gained on the packing characteristics of the material  \r\n\r\n being tested. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The second charge, after tamping, should fill the mould to about two  \r\n\r\n thirds of its depth and the third and final charge, after tamping, should  \r\n\r\n reach to just below the top of the mould (see fig. D.1.1.4-2). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 Tamping procedure. A tamper of a type illustrated in fig. D.1.1.2-4  \r\n\r\n should be used. Since the tamping operation is performed manually, it is  \r\n\r\n difficult to define clearly an exact and reproducible procedure. However, the  \r\n\r\n aim should be to attain a degree of compaction similar to that prevailing at  \r\n\r\n the bottom of a shipboard cargo of the material being tested. To this end, it  \r\n\r\n is recommended that firm pressure of the tamper (not distinct blows) should  \r\n\r\n be applied successively over the whole area of the sample until a uniformly  \r\n\r\n at surface is obtained over the entire area, particularly at the outer edges  \r\n\r\n of each successive layer. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 Removal of the mould. The mould is tapped on its side until it becomes  \r\n\r\n loose, leaving the sample in the shape of a truncated cone on the table. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.1.4.2 The preliminary flow moisture test </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 Immediately after removing the mould, the flow table is raised and  \r\n\r\n dropped up to 50 times through a height of 12.5 mm at a rate of 25 times per  \r\n\r\n minute. If the material is below the flow moisture point, it usually crumbles  \r\n\r\n and bumps off in fragments with successive drops of the table (see fig.  \r\n\r\n D.1.1.4-3). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 At this stage, the flow table is stopped and the material returned to  \r\n\r\n the mixing bowl where 5-10 ml of water, or possibly more, is sprinkled over  \r\n\r\n the surface and thoroughly mixed into the material, either with rubber gloved  \r\n\r\n fingers or an automatic mixer. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The mould is again filled and the flow table is operated as described in  \r\n\r\n D.1.1.4.2.1 for up to 50 drops. If a flow state is not developed, the process  \r\n\r\n is repeated with further additions of water until a flow state has been  \r\n\r\n reached. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 Identification of a flow state. The impacting action of the flow table  \r\n\r\n causes the grains to rearrange themselves to produce compaction of the mass.  \r\n\r\n As a result, the fixed volume of moisture contained in the material at any  \r\n\r\n given level increases as a percentage of the total volume. A flow state is  \r\n\r\n considered to have been reached when the moisture content and compaction of  \r\n\r\n the sample produce a level of saturation such that plastic deformation  \r\n\r\n occurs.(* 7) At this stage, the moulded sides of the sample may deform,  \r\n\r\n giving a convex or concave profile (see fig. D.1.1.4-4). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>With repeated action of the flow table, the sample continues to slump and  \r\n\r\n to flow outwards. In certain materials cracks may also develop on the top  \r\n\r\n surface. Cracking without the appearance of free moisture is not however an  \r\n\r\n indication of development of a flow state. In most cases, measurement of the  \r\n\r\n deformation is helpful in deciding whether or not plastic flow has occurred.  \r\n\r\n A template which, for example, will indicate an increase in diameter of up to  \r\n\r\n 3 mm in any part of the cone is a useful guide for this purpose. Some  \r\n\r\n additional observations may be useful. For example: When the (increasing)  \r\n\r\n moisture content is approaching the flow moisture point the sample cone  \r\n\r\n begins to show a tendency to stick to the mould. Further, when the sample is  \r\n\r\n pushed off the table, the sample may leave tracks (stripes) of moisture on  \r\n\r\n the table. If such stripes are seen the moisture content may be above the  \r\n\r\n flow moisture point. Deformation of the cone may appear at moisture contents  \r\n\r\n lower than the flow moisture point, but in that case the sample will leave no  \r\n\r\n moisture tracks when removed. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Measuring the diameter of the cone, at the base or at half height, will  \r\n\r\n always be useful. By addition of water in increments of 0.4 to 0.5 per cent  \r\n\r\n and applying 25 drops of the flow table, the first diameter increase will  \r\n\r\n generally be between 1 and 5 mm and after a further increment of water the  \r\n\r\n base diameter would have expanded to between 5 and 10 mm. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.4 As an alternative to the procedure described above, for many  \r\n\r\n concentrates a fast way of finding the approximate flow moisture point is as  \r\n\r\n follows: When the moisture content is definitely beyond the flow moisture  \r\n\r\n point, measure the diameter after 25 knocks, repeat the test after adding a  \r\n\r\n further increment of water, measure the diameter and draw a diagram as  \r\n\r\n illustrated in fig. D.1.1.4-1 showing increase in diameter plotted against  \r\n\r\n moisture content. A straight line drawn through the two points will cross the  \r\n\r\n moisture content axis close to the flow moisture point. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=65661&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.1.4.3 The main flow moisture test </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>When a flow state has been reached in the preliminary test, the moisture  \r\n\r\n content of sub-sample (C) is adjusted to approximately the last value which  \r\n\r\n did not cause flow in the preliminary test. The final test is then carried  \r\n\r\n out on this adjusted sample in the same manner as for the preliminary test,  \r\n\r\n but in this case with the addition of water in increments of only 0.4 to 0.5  \r\n\r\n per cent of the weight of the test material. At each stage a representative  \r\n\r\n sample of 100-200 grams is taken from the mixing bowl, placed in a closed  \r\n\r\n weighing glass and retained for moisture determination if required. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>When a flow state has been reached, the moisture content should be  \r\n\r\n determined on two samples, one with a moisture content just above the flow  \r\n\r\n moisture point and the other with a moisture content just below the flow  \r\n\r\n moisture point. The difference between the two values should then be 0.5 per  \r\n\r\n cent or less and the flow moisture point is taken as the mean of these two  \r\n\r\n values. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.1.4.4 Determination of moisture content </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Introduction </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>It should be noted that for many materials, there are recognized  \r\n\r\n international and national methods for determining moisture content.

In practice, this is ascertained after a suitable drying period, by  \r\n\r\n weighing the sample successively with an interval of several hours elapsing.  \r\n\r\n If the weight remains constant, drying has been completed; whereas if the  \r\n\r\n weight is still decreasing, drying is continued. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The length of the drying period depends upon many variables such as the  \r\n\r\n disposition of the material in the oven, the type of container used, the  \r\n\r\n particle size, the rate of heat transfer, etc. It may be that a period of  \r\n\r\n five hours is ample for one concentrate sample whereas it is not sufficient  \r\n\r\n for another. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Sulphide concentrates tend to oxidize and therefore the use of drying  \r\n\r\n ovens with air circulation systems is not recommended for these materials,  \r\n\r\n nor should the test sample be left in the drying oven for more than four  \r\n\r\n hours. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Examples of calculation </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Taking w1 as the exact weight of the sub-sample as received of  \r\n\r\n approximately 1/5 of the gross sample (see D.1.1.4.2); </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Taking w2 as the exact weight of the first sub-sample after drying of  \r\n\r\n approximately 1/5 of the gross sample (see D.1.1.4.2); </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Taking w3 as the exact weight of the sample just above flow state of  \r\n\r\n approximately 100-200 g (see D.1.1.4.2); Taking w4 as the exact weight of the  \r\n\r\n sample just above flow state after drying of approximately 100-200 g (see  \r\n\r\n D.1.1.4.3); </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Taking w5 as the exact weight of the sample just below flow state (see  \r\n\r\n D.1.1.4.3); </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Taking w6 as the exact weight of the sample just below flow state after  \r\n\r\n drying (see D.1.1.4.3); </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Then </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.1 The moisture content of the concentrate as received is </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n          (w1 - w2)  \r\n\r\n          --------- x 100          (D.1.1.4.4.1)  \r\n\r\n              w1  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P>.2 The flow moisture point of the concentrate is </P>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=65661&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.3 The transportable moisture limit of the concentrate is </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n 90% of formula    (D.1.1.4.4.2)  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=65661&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.2 Test procedures for coals </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.2.1 Coals with maximum grain size below 1 mm </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The procedures described in D.1.1.2 to D.1.1.4.3 inclusive apply. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.1.2.1.1 Determination of moisture content </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The recommended methods for determinations of the moisture content are  \r\n\r\n those described in ISO 589-1974 &#187;Hard coal - Determination of total  \r\n\r\n moisture&#171;.

Other means may be used to obtain the  \r\n\r\n required tilting but in all cases vibration must be eliminated. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.5 To pressurize the hydraulic cylinder, a hydropneumatic accumulator may  \r\n\r\n be used, pressurized by air or gas at a pressure of about 5  \r\n\r\n kp/squarecentimetre. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.6 The rate of tilting should be approximately 0.3 degrees/sec. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.7 Range of tilt should be at least 50 degrees. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.8 A protractor is fitted to the end of the shaft. One lever of the  \r\n\r\n protractor is fitted so that it may be screw-adjusted to the horizontal. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.9 The protractor should measure the angle of the top of the box to the  \r\n\r\n horizontal to within an accuracy of 0.5 degrees. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>.10 A spirit level or some other levelling device must be available to  \r\n\r\n zero the protractor. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.1.5 Procedure </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The box is filled with the material to be tested by pouring it slowly and  \r\n\r\n carefully from the lowest practical height into the box in order to obtain  \r\n\r\n uniformity of loading. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The excess material is scraped off by the aid of a straight edge, inclined  \r\n\r\n at about 45 degrees towards the direction of scraping. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The tilting system is then activated and stopped when the material just  \r\n\r\n begins to slide in bulk. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The angle of the top of the box to the horizontal is measured by the  \r\n\r\n protractor and recorded. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.1.6 Evaluation </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The angle of repose is calculated as the mean of three measurements and is  \r\n\r\n reported to within half a degree. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Notes </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Preferably the test should be carried out with three independent samples.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Care should be taken to ensure that the shaft is adjusted to be horizontal  \r\n\r\n before testing. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=65661&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.2 Alternative or shipboard test method to be used for the  \r\n\r\n determination of the angle of repose when the tilting box is not available  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.2.1 Definition </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>According to this method the angle of repose is the angle between the cone  \r\n\r\n slope and the horizontal measured at half height. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.2.2 Principle of test </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>To determine the angle of repose, a quantity of the material to be tested  \r\n\r\n is poured very carefully out of a flask onto a sheet of rough-textured paper,  \r\n\r\n in such a way that a symmetrical cone is formed. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.2.3 Equipment </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The necessary equipment to carry out this test is as follows: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- a horizontal table free from vibrations; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- a sheet of rough-textured paper onto which the material should be  \r\n\r\n poured; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- a protractor; </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>- a 3 litre conical flask. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.2.2.4 Procedure </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Put the sheet of paper on the table.

The tendency of a fertilizer to undergo this type of decomposition  \r\n\r\n can be determined by means of the through test. In this test localized  \r\n\r\n decomposition is initiated in a bed of the fertilizer to be offered for  \r\n\r\n shipment contained in a horizontally mounted trough, and the rate at which  \r\n\r\n the decomposition propagates through it is measured after removal of the  \r\n\r\n initiating heat source. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.2 Apparatus </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The apparatus (fig. D.4-1) consists of a trough of internal dimensions 150  \r\n\r\n x 150 x 500 mm, open at the top. The trough is constructed of square meshed  \r\n\r\n gauze (preferably stainless steel) with a mesh width of about 2.5 mm and a  \r\n\r\n wire thickness of 1.5 mm. The bars have a diameter of 10 mm. Fertilizers with  \r\n\r\n a particle size distribution such that a significant amount falls through the  \r\n\r\n mesh of the trough should be tested in a trough of smaller mesh gauze, or  \r\n\r\n alternatively in a trough lined with gauze of a smaller mesh. During  \r\n\r\n initiation sufficient heat should be provided and maintained to established a  \r\n\r\n uniform decomposition front. Two alternative methods are recommended, viz:  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.2.1 Electrical heating </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>An electrical heating element (capacity 250 watts) enclosed in a stainless  \r\n\r\n steel box is placed inside and at one end of the trough (fig. D.4.2). The  \r\n\r\n dimensions of the stainless steel box are 150 x 150 x 10 mm, and the wall  \r\n\r\n thickness 3 mm. The side of the box which is not in contact with the  \r\n\r\n fertilizer should be insulated with an asbestos plate (5 mm thick). The  \r\n\r\n heating side of the box may be protected with aluminium foil or a stainless  \r\n\r\n steel plate. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.2.2 Gas burners </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>A steel plate (thickness 1-3 mm) is placed inside one end of the trough  \r\n\r\n and in contact with the wire mesh (fig. D.4-1). The plate is heated by means  \r\n\r\n of two Teclu burners which are fixed to the trough support and are capable of  \r\n\r\n maintaining the plate at temperatures between 400-800 degrees C, i.e. dull  \r\n\r\n red heat. For example, this may be achieved by a burner capacity of about 200  \r\n\r\n cubic decimetre/h of town gas at a pressure of 6 cm water assuming a  \r\n\r\n specification of town gas as follows: </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>higher calorific value 4200 kcal/cubic metre, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>lower calorific value 3750 kcal/cubic metre, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>s = 0 degrees C, 760 mm Hg. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.2.3 To prevent heat transport along the outside of the trough a heat  \r\n\r\n shield consisting of a steel plate (2 mm thick) should be installed at about  \r\n\r\n 5 cm from the end of the trough where the heating takes place. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.2.4 The life of the apparatus may be prolonged if it is constructed of  \r\n\r\n stainless steel throughout. This is particularly important in the case of the  \r\n\r\n gauze trough. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.3 Procedure </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.3.1 The apparatus should be set up under a fume hood to remove toxic  \r\n\r\n decomposition gases. Although there is no explosion risk, when performing the  \r\n\r\n test it is advisable to have a protective shield, e.g. of suitable  \r\n\r\n transparent plastics, between the observer and the apparatus. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.3.2 The trough is filled with a fertilizer in the form to be offered  \r\n\r\n for shipment and decomposition is initiated at one end, either electrically  \r\n\r\n or by means of gas burners as described above. Heating should be continued  \r\n\r\n until decomposition of the fertilizer is well established and propagation of  \r\n\r\n the front (over approximately 3-5 cm) has been observed. In the case of  \r\n\r\n products with high thermal stability it may be necessary to continue heating  \r\n\r\n for one hour. In the case of fertilizers which show a tendency to melt, the  \r\n\r\n heating should be done carefully, i.e. with a small flame. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.3.3 About 20 minutes after the heating has been discontinued, the  \r\n\r\n position of the decomposition front is noted. The front can be observed by  \r\n\r\n difference in colour, e.g. brown (undecomposed fertilizer) to white  \r\n\r\n (decomposed fertilizer). A graph of the progression of the decomposition  \r\n\r\n front along the trough against time is then prepared, and the propagation  \r\n\r\n rate (cm/h) is obtained from the graph, using the portion where the rate is  \r\n\r\n constant. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.4 Results </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.4.1 If propagation of the decomposition continues throughout the  \r\n\r\n entire trough, the fertilizer is capable of showing self-sustaining  \r\n\r\n decomposition. The propagation rate (cm/h) is noted. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>D.4.4.2 If propagation does not continue throughout the entire trough, the  \r\n\r\n fertilizer is regarded as free from the hazard of self-sustaining  \r\n\r\n decomposition. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=65661&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt
