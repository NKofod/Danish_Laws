However, the basic information should  \r\n\r\n be completed as soon as practicable. Furthermore, it is recommended that the  \r\n\r\n booklet should be in such a form that additional data for each manoeuvre  \r\n\r\n could be added and that shipmasters be encouraged to add to this basic  \r\n\r\n information as they gain experience in the handling of the vessel in  \r\n\r\n conditions not covered by the original data. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Copies of the appropriate diagrams should be posted on the bridge. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>All data provided should be for calm weather, no current and deepwater  \r\n\r\n conditions with clean hull. These facts should be clearly noted on the data  \r\n\r\n displayed with a warning that the vessel's response may significantly change  \r\n\r\n under different conditions, including shallow water. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>2.</B> Supplementary information </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The attention of masters is drawn to the following points which should be  \r\n\r\n considered in relation to the safe handling of the ship: </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(i) Squat. The decrease in clearance under the keel when a vessel is  \r\n\r\n under way in shallow water is known as squat, and varies with speed. A vessel  \r\n\r\n which will in certain circumstances squat several feet can effectively reduce  \r\n\r\n this by a substantial reduction in speed. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(ii) The extent of &#187;blind zone&#171; forward created by the forward  \r\n\r\n part of the vessel may be inhibiting and its extent should be determined in  \r\n\r\n both loaded and ballast conditions. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(iii) Consideration should be given to the effective increase in draught  \r\n\r\n due to the ship motion in a seaway. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(iv) It should be noted that where practicable the quickest method of  \r\n\r\n reducing headway is to turn under the influence of full rudder, with or  \r\n\r\n without the use of engine astern power. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n</DIV><div class=\"bjelke\">Officielle noter</div><DIV CLASS=PARA ID=\"NOTER\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Ingen </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV>",
