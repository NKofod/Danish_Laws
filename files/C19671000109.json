They should be  \r\n\r\n arranged so as to secure an effective distribution of water in the spaces  \r\n\r\n which are to be protected. For this purpose, the system should be such as  \r\n\r\n will provide water application at a rate of at least 3.5 litres per square  \r\n\r\n metre per minute (0.07 gallons per square foot per minute) for spaces with a  \r\n\r\n deck height not exceeding 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n<P>and a capacity of at least 5 litres per square metre per minute (0.1  \r\n\r\n gallons per square foot per minute) for spaces with a deck height of 2.5  \r\n\r\n metres (8.2 feet) or more. </P>  \r\n\r\n<UL CLASS=PLAIN-LIST>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(b) The water pressure should be sufficient to secure an even  \r\n\r\n distribution of water. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(c) The system should normally cover the full breadth of the vehicle deck  \r\n\r\n and may be divided into sections provided they are of at least 20 metres (66  \r\n\r\n feet) in length, except that in ships where the vehicle deck space is  \r\n\r\n subdivided with longitudinal &#187;A&#171; Class divisions forming boundaries  \r\n\r\n of staircases, etc., the breadth of the sections may be reduced accordingly.  \r\n\r\n</LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(d) The distribution valves for the system should be situated in an  \r\n\r\n easily accessible position adjacent to but outside the space to be protected  \r\n\r\n which will not readily be cut off by a fire within the space. Direct access  \r\n\r\n to the distribution valves from the vehicle deck space and from outside that  \r\n\r\n space should be provided. Adequate ventilation should be fitted in the space  \r\n\r\n containing the distribution valves. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(e) The water supply to the system should be provided by a pump or pumps  \r\n\r\n other than the ship's required fire pumps which should additionally be  \r\n\r\n connected to the system by a lockable non-return valve which will prevent a  \r\n\r\n back-flow from the system into the fire main. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(f) The principal pump or pumps should be capable of providing  \r\n\r\n simultaneously at all times a sufficient supply of water at the required  \r\n\r\n pressure to all nozzles in the vehicle deck or in at least two sections  \r\n\r\n thereof. </LI>  \r\n\r\n<LI>(g) The principal pump or pumps should be capable of being brought into  \r\n\r\n operation by remote control (which may be manually actuated) from the positon  \r\n\r\n at which the distribution valves are situated. </LI>  \r\n\r\n</UL>  \r\n\r\n</DIV><div class=\"bjelke\">Officielle noter</div><DIV CLASS=PARA ID=\"NOTER\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>(* 1) &#187;Special category spaces&#171; are those enclosed spaces above  \r\n\r\n or below the bulkhead deck intended for the carriage of motor vehicles with  \r\n\r\n fuel in their tanks for their own propulsion, into and from which such  \r\n\r\n vehicles can be driven and to which passengers have access. </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV>",
