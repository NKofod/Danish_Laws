Spaces containing inert gas generators  \r\n\r\n should have no direct access to accommodation, service or control station  \r\n\r\n spaces, but may be located in machinery spaces. If they are not located in  \r\n\r\n machinery spaces they shall be located in a compartment reserved solely for  \r\n\r\n their use. Such a compartment shall be separated by a gastight steel bulkhead  \r\n\r\n and/or deck from accommodation, service and control station spaces as defined  \r\n\r\n in the Bulk Chemical Code. Adequate positive pressure type mechanical  \r\n\r\n ventilation shall be provided for such a compartment. Access to such  \r\n\r\n compartments located aft shall be only from an open deck outside the cargo  \r\n\r\n tank area. Access shall be located on the end bulkhead not facing the cargo  \r\n\r\n area and/or on the outboard side of the superstructure or deckhouse at a  \r\n\r\n distance of at least 25 per cent of the length of the ship but not less than  \r\n\r\n 5 m from the end of the superstructure or deckhouse facing the cargo area. In  \r\n\r\n the case of such a compartment being located in the forecastle, access shall  \r\n\r\n be through the deckhead forward of the cargo area. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.3 Inert gas piping systems shall not pass through accommodation, service  \r\n\r\n and control station spaces. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1 Means shall be provided which will effectively cool the volume of gas  \r\n\r\n specified in paragraph 3 and remove solids and sulphur combustion products.  \r\n\r\n The cooling water arrangements shall be such that an adequate supply of water  \r\n\r\n will always be available without interfering with any essential services on  \r\n\r\n the ship. Provision shall also be made for alternative supply of cooling  \r\n\r\n water. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.2 Filters or equivalent devices shall be fitted to minimize the amount  \r\n\r\n of water carried over to the inert gas main. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1 Two air blowers shall be fitted to each inert gas generator, which  \r\n\r\n together shall be capable of delivering to the cargo tanks, required to be  \r\n\r\n protected by the system, at least the volume of gas required by paragraph 3.  \r\n\r\n An Administration may permit only one blower if it is capable of delivering  \r\n\r\n to the protected cargo tanks the total volume of gas required by paragraph 3,  \r\n\r\n provided that sufficient spares for the air blower and its prime mover are  \r\n\r\n carried on board to enable any failure of the air blower and its prime mover  \r\n\r\n to be rectified. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.2 The inert gas systems shall be so designed that the maximum pressure  \r\n\r\n which they can exert on any cargo tank will not exceed the test pressure of  \r\n\r\n any cargo tank. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.3 Where more than one inert gas generator is provided suitable shut-off  \r\n\r\n arrangements shall be provided on the discharge outlet of each generator  \r\n\r\n plant. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.4 Arrangements shall be made to vent the inert gas to the atmosphere in  \r\n\r\n case the inert gas produced is off-specification, e.g. during starting-up or  \r\n\r\n in case of equipment failure. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.5 Where inert gas generators are served by positive displacement blowers  \r\n\r\n a pressure relief device shall be provided to prevent excess pressure being  \r\n\r\n developed on the discharge side of the blower. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7 Two fuel oil shall be fitted to each inert gas generator. An  \r\n\r\n Administration may permit only one fuel oil pump on condition that sufficient  \r\n\r\n spares for the fuel oil pump and its prime mover are carried on board to  \r\n\r\n enable any failure of the fuel oil pump and its prime mover to be rectified  \r\n\r\n by the ship's crew. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>8 A gas regulating valve shall be fitted in the inert gas supply main.  \r\n\r\n This valve shall be automatically controlled to close as required in  \r\n\r\n paragraphs 17.2 and 17.3. It shall also be capable of automatically  \r\n\r\n regulating the flow of inert gas to the cargo tanks unless other means are  \r\n\r\n provided to automatically control the inert gas flow rate. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.1 At least two non-return devices, one of which shall be a water seal,  \r\n\r\n shall be fitted in the inert gas supply main in order to prevent the return  \r\n\r\n of flammable vapour to the inert gas generator and to any gas-safe space  \r\n\r\n under all normal conditions of trim, list and motion of the ship. They shall  \r\n\r\n be located between the automatic valve required by paragraph 8 and the first  \r\n\r\n connexion to any cargo tank or cargo pipeline. An Administration may permit  \r\n\r\n an alternative arrangement or device providing a measure of safety equivalent  \r\n\r\n to that of a water seal. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.2 The devices referred to in paragraph 9.1 shall be located in the cargo  \r\n\r\n tank area to deck. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.3 The water seal referred to in paragraph 9.1 shall be capable of being  \r\n\r\n supplied by two separate pumps, each of which shall be capable of mainting an  \r\n\r\n adequate supply at all times. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.4 The arrangement of the water seal and its associated provisions shall  \r\n\r\n be such that it will prevent backflow of flammable vapours and will ensure  \r\n\r\n the proper functioning of the water seal under operating conditions. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.5 Provision shall be made to ensure that any water seal is protected  \r\n\r\n against freezing, in such a way that the integrity of water seal is not  \r\n\r\n impaired by overheating. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.6 A water loop or other approved arrangements shall also be fitted to  \r\n\r\n all associated water supply and drain piping and to all venting or pressure  \r\n\r\n sensing piping leading to gas-safe spaces.(* 3) Means shall be provided to  \r\n\r\n prevent such loops from being emptied by vacuum. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.7 Any water seal or equivalent device and all loop arrangements shall be  \r\n\r\n capable of preventing the return of flammable vapours to an inert gas  \r\n\r\n generator at a pressure equal to the test pressure of the cargo tanks. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.8 The second device shall be a non-return valve or equivalent capable of  \r\n\r\n preventing the return of vapours or liquids or both and fitted between the  \r\n\r\n water seal (or the equivalent device) required in paragraph 9.1 and the first  \r\n\r\n connexion from the inert gas main to a cargo tank. It shall be provided with  \r\n\r\n positive means of closure. As an alternative to positive means of closure, an  \r\n\r\n additional valve having such means of closure may be provided between the  \r\n\r\n non-return valve and the first connexion to the cargo tanks to isolate the  \r\n\r\n water seal (or equivalent device). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>9.9 As an additional safeguard against the possible leakage of flammable  \r\n\r\n liquids or vapours back from the deck main, means shall be provided to permit  \r\n\r\n this section of the line between the valve having positive means of closure  \r\n\r\n referred to in paragraph 9.8 and the valve referred to in paragraph 8 to be  \r\n\r\n vented in a safe manner when the first of these valves is closed. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.1 The inert gas main may be divided into two or more branches between  \r\n\r\n the non-return devices required by paragraph 9 and the cargo tanks. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>10.2 Inert gas supply mains shall be fitted with branch piping leading to  \r\n\r\n each cargo tank designated for the carriage of flammable products required to  \r\n\r\n be inerted by this Regulation.
