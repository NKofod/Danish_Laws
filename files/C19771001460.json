Where one side of  \r\n\r\n            the specimen is expected to give a performance inferior to  \r\n\r\n            that of its other side, the Administration may require the  \r\n\r\n            specimen to be tested only from that side which is  \r\n\r\n            expected to give the inferior performance.  \r\n\r\n      .4    A specimen of a deck or ceiling construction should be  \r\n\r\n            tested with only the underside of the specimen exposed to  \r\n\r\n            the furnace.  \r\n\r\n      .5    The specimen should be secured as follows:  \r\n\r\n      .5.1  In the case of an &#187;A&#171; class division, or a &#187;B&#171;  \r\n\r\n class deck  \r\n\r\n            or ceiling, or an &#187;F&#171; class deck or ceiling, the  \r\n\r\n specimen  \r\n\r\n            should be restricted against expansion on all four sides,  \r\n\r\n            except if it is intended in service to provide movement  \r\n\r\n            for expansion at the edges of a ceiling or at intervals  \r\n\r\n            across it in the longitudinal or transverse direction, the  \r\n\r\n            test specimen should simulate these conditions. Details of  \r\n\r\n            the method of securing and destricting the specimen should  \r\n\r\n            be shown in the test report.  \r\n\r\n      .5.2  In the case of a &#187;B&#171; or &#187;F&#171; class bulkhead,  \r\n\r\n the specimen  \r\n\r\n            should be supported at the top and secured on the vertical  \r\n\r\n            sides and at the bottom in a manner representative of the  \r\n\r\n            conditions in service. Details of the method of securing  \r\n\r\n            the specimen should be shown in the test report. If  \r\n\r\n            provision for movement at the edges of a bulkhead is made  \r\n\r\n            for a particular construction in service, the specimen  \r\n\r\n            should simulate these conditions.  \r\n\r\n      .5.3  The method of securing should be such that there is no  \r\n\r\n            possibility of misinterpretation of test results of  \r\n\r\n            passage of flame and smoke for &#187;A&#171; class divisions and  \r\n\r\n            passage of flame for &#187;B&#171; or &#187;F&#171; class  \r\n\r\n divisions at the  \r\n\r\n            edges of the specimen when the method of fixing is not the  \r\n\r\n            subject of the test.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.3 Furnace control:  \r\n\r\n      .1.1  In the case of a specimen size specified in figures 1 and  \r\n\r\n            2, the furnace temperature should be determined by means  \r\n\r\n            of four thermocouples of not less than 0.75 mm diameter  \r\n\r\n            and not more than 1.5 mm diameter. For specimens larger  \r\n\r\n            than specified in figures 1 and 2, additional  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples should be provided in the proportion one per  \r\n\r\n            1.25 square meter of the specimen area. In the case of a  \r\n\r\n            door assembly, specimen area refers to the entire bulkhead  \r\n\r\n            construction with the door fitted. Thermocouples should be  \r\n\r\n            uniformly disposed over the specimen area with a spacing  \r\n\r\n            between the therocouples in the horizontal and vertical  \r\n\r\n            plane, within the range of 0.75 m to 1.25 m.  \r\n\r\n      .1.2  The thermocouples should be arranged with each hot  \r\n\r\n            junction at such a position that an arc of 100 mm radius  \r\n\r\n            described from that junction meets the exposed face of the  \r\n\r\n            specimen or any projection. The hot junctions of the  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples should not be located at positions within  \r\n\r\n            the furnace where they are subject to direct flame  \r\n\r\n            impingement.  \r\n\r\n      .1.3  The hot junction of the thermocouples may be formed by  \r\n\r\n            welding or crimping the ends of the wires. The crimping  \r\n\r\n            should be done by using a crimping tip as shown in figure  \r\n\r\n            3.  \r\n\r\n      .1.4  Other types of thermocouples may also used to control the  \r\n\r\n            furnace temperature. In all cases the response time  \r\n\r\n            characteristics of the thermocouples should not be  \r\n\r\n            inferior to that provided by a crimped tip thermocouple  \r\n\r\n            having a mass of 0.38 g.  \r\n\r\n      .1.5  The wires should be insulated from each other by ceramic  \r\n\r\n            insulators or similar of not more than 10 mm diameter and  \r\n\r\n            the hot junction should project 25 mm from the end of the  \r\n\r\n            insulators. The insulated wires should be housed and  \r\n\r\n            supported in suitable heat resisting steel tubes (e.g.  \r\n\r\n            &#187;Inconel&#171; or chromite) and arranged so that the ceramic  \r\n\r\n or  \r\n\r\n            similar insulated portion projects 75 mm. The steel tubes  \r\n\r\n            should be sealed and packed with a high temperature  \r\n\r\n            insulant or fire clay. A sketch of a thermocouple is shown  \r\n\r\n            in figure 4.  \r\n\r\n      .1.6  Provision should be made for the steel tubes to be movable  \r\n\r\n            in order that the 100 mm spacing may be maintained between  \r\n\r\n            the hot junctions of the thermocouples and the test  \r\n\r\n            specimen where distortion of the specimen occurs.  \r\n\r\n      .1.7  The thermocouple wire should be either continuous to the  \r\n\r\n            recording instrument or suitable compensating wire should  \r\n\r\n            be used with all junctions maintained as near as possible  \r\n\r\n            at ambient temperature conditions.  \r\n\r\n      .2    The furnace temperature rises should be continuously  \r\n\r\n            controlled so as to follow the standard time-temperature  \r\n\r\n            curve within the limits specified in .4 below.  \r\n\r\n      .3    The standard time-temperature curve is defined by a smooth  \r\n\r\n            curve drawn through the following points measured above  \r\n\r\n            the initial furnace temperature:  \r\n\r\n      At the end of the first 5 minutes       556 degrees centigrade  \r\n\r\n      At the end of the first 10 minutes      659 degrees centigrade  \r\n\r\n      At the end of the first 15 minutes      718 degrees centigrade  \r\n\r\n      At the end of the first 30 minutes      821 degrees centigrade  \r\n\r\n      At the end of the first 60 minutes      925 degrees centigrade  \r\n\r\n      .4    The accuracy of the furnace control should be as follows:  \r\n\r\n      .4.1  During the first 10 minutes of the test the area under the  \r\n\r\n            curve of mean furnace temperature should not vary by more  \r\n\r\n            than plus/minus 15 pct. of the area under the standard  \r\n\r\n            curve.  \r\n\r\n      .4.2  During the first half hour of the test the area under the  \r\n\r\n            curve of mean furnace temperature should not vary by more  \r\n\r\n            than plus/minus 10 pct. of the area under the standard  \r\n\r\n            curve.  \r\n\r\n      .4.3   For any period after the first half hour of the test the  \r\n\r\n            area under the curve of mean furnace temperature should  \r\n\r\n            not vary by more than plus/minus 5 pct. of the area under  \r\n\r\n            the standard curve.  \r\n\r\n      .4.4  At any time after the first 10 minutes of the test the  \r\n\r\n            mean furnace temperature should not differ from the  \r\n\r\n            standard curve by more than plus/minus 100 degrees  \r\n\r\n            centigrade.  \r\n\r\n      .5    Pressure in the furnace:  \r\n\r\n      .5.1  An overpressure should exist in the furnace relative to  \r\n\r\n            the laboratory during the whole heating period of an  \r\n\r\n &#187;A&#171;,  \r\n\r\n            &#187;B&#171; or &#187;F&#171; class test except during the first  \r\n\r\n 5 minutes of  \r\n\r\n            the test when the overpressure may be outside the limits  \r\n\r\n            specified in 5.2 below.  \r\n\r\n For bulkhead and door assemblies, the overpressure should exist over  \r\n\r\n            at least the upper two thirds of the height of the test  \r\n\r\n            specimen.  \r\n\r\n      .5.2   An overpressure equal to 10 plus/minus 2 pascals (1  \r\n\r\n            plus/minus 0.2 mm water gauge) based on a short period  \r\n\r\n            average of rapid fluctuations should be measured and  \r\n\r\n            monitored:  \r\n\r\n      -     in the case of deck and ceiling constructions, at a point  \r\n\r\n            100 mm below the lower surface of the test specimen; and  \r\n\r\n      -     in the case of bulkheads or bulkheads incorporating door  \r\n\r\n            assemblies, at a point located approximately three  \r\n\r\n            quarters of the height of the test specimen.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.4 Construction of thermocouples for measuring the temperature on  \r\n\r\n            the unexposed side of the specimen (see figure 5):  \r\n\r\n      .1.1  Each thermocouple should be of 0.5 mm diameter wires  \r\n\r\n            brazed to a copper disc 12 mm in diameter and 0.2 mm in  \r\n\r\n            thickness.  \r\n\r\n      .1.2  Both wires should be brazed to the same face of the disc,  \r\n\r\n            at positions diametrically opposite with an overlap onto  \r\n\r\n            the copper disc of at least 4 mm (see figure 5).  \r\n\r\n      .1.3  The thermocouples should be covered with an asbestos pad,  \r\n\r\n            30 mm square by 2 mm thick.  \r\n\r\n      .1.4  The asbestos pad should have a density of 900  \r\n\r\n            kg/cubicmeter plus/minus 10 pct. and a thermal  \r\n\r\n            conductivity of 0.13 W/m/ degrees centigrade plus/minus 10  \r\n\r\n            pct. at 100 degrees centigrade. Other materials with  \r\n\r\n            similar thermal properties may be used in place of the  \r\n\r\n            asbestos.  \r\n\r\n      .1.5  The thermocouple constructional procedure should be as  \r\n\r\n            follows: the pad should be drilled to allow the wires to  \r\n\r\n            pass through it, the holes being the same diameter as the  \r\n\r\n            wire, at positions along a centreline 12 mm apart equally  \r\n\r\n            spaced from the edges. The face of the thermocouple disc  \r\n\r\n            with wires brazed thereto should be in contakt with the  \r\n\r\n            face of the pad thus ensuring a smooth surface for contact  \r\n\r\n            with the specimen. No adhesive should be used between the  \r\n\r\n            thermocouple and the pad.  \r\n\r\n      .1.6  The thermocouple wires should protrude from the pad by at  \r\n\r\n            least 150 mm and should be insulated with a woven sleeving  \r\n\r\n            of glass or similar fibre. Any other suitable material may  \r\n\r\n            be to sheathe the thermocouple wires provided that such  \r\n\r\n            material is not likely to become damaged during the test.  \r\n\r\n      .1.7  Connection to the measuring instrument should be by wires  \r\n\r\n            of similar or appropriate compensating type.  \r\n\r\n      .1.8  The thermocouple leads should be supported in such a way  \r\n\r\n            that the thermocouples and/or leads do not become  \r\n\r\n            disconnected during the test due to their weight or to the  \r\n\r\n            distortion of the test specimen.  \r\n\r\n      .2    The thermocouples should be fixed to the unexposed surface  \r\n\r\n            of the specimen as follows:  \r\n\r\n      .2.1  Steel: The asbestos pad with the thermocouple fitted  \r\n\r\n            should be bonded to the cleaned surface of the steel using  \r\n\r\n            a &#187;water-based ceramic cement&#171; produced by integrating  \r\n\r\n the  \r\n\r\n            components to form a high temperature resistant adhesive.  \r\n\r\n            The adhesive should be of such a consistency that no  \r\n\r\n            mechanical aid is necessary for retention purposes during  \r\n\r\n            the drying process, but where difficulty in bonding is  \r\n\r\n            experienced, retention by adhesive tape may be employed  \r\n\r\n            provided that the tape is removed sufficiently long in  \r\n\r\n            advance of the test to allow complete drying of the  \r\n\r\n            adhesive. Care is required in the removal of the tape to  \r\n\r\n            ensure that the asbestos pad is not damaged. If the  \r\n\r\n            thermocouple pad is damaged when the tape is removed then  \r\n\r\n            the thermocouple should be replaced.  \r\n\r\n      .2.2  Fibrous surfaces: The thermocouples with asbestos pads  \r\n\r\n            fitted should be arranged in such a way that if a surface  \r\n\r\n            wire mesh is present it may aid retention and in all cases  \r\n\r\n            the bond to the fibrous surface should be made using a  \r\n\r\n            &#187;contact&#171; adhesive. The nature of the adhesive  \r\n\r\n            necessitates a drying time before mating surfaces are put  \r\n\r\n            together thus obviating the need for external pressure.  \r\n\r\n      .2.3  Site applied wet fibrous spray: Thermocouples should not  \r\n\r\n            be fitted until the insulation has reached a stable  \r\n\r\n            moisture condition. In all cases the bonding technique for  \r\n\r\n            steel should be used and where a surface wire mesh is  \r\n\r\n            present the thermocouples should be affixed to the  \r\n\r\n            insulation in such a way that the wire mesh aids  \r\n\r\n            retention.  \r\n\r\n      .2.4  Site applied mineral aggregate spray; The technique  \r\n\r\n            specified for wet fibrous spray should be employed.  \r\n\r\n      .2.5  Boards of fibrous or mineral aggregate composition: The  \r\n\r\n            bonding technique for steel should be used.  \r\n\r\n      .2.6  In all cases of adhesive bonding the adhesive should be  \r\n\r\n            applied in a thin(* 4) film sufficient to give an adequate  \r\n\r\n            bond and there should be a sufficient lapse of time  \r\n\r\n            between the bonding of the thermocouples and the test for  \r\n\r\n            stable moisture conditons to be attained in the case of  \r\n\r\n            the ceramic adhesive and evaporation of the solvent in the  \r\n\r\n            case of the content adhesive.  \r\n\r\n      .3    Preparation of the surface to receive the thermocouples:  \r\n\r\n      .3.1  Steel: Surface finishes should be removed and the surface  \r\n\r\n            cleaned with a solvent. Loose rust and scale should be  \r\n\r\n            removed by wire brush.  \r\n\r\n      .3.2  Irregular surfaces: A smooth surface not greater than 100  \r\n\r\n            square millimeter to provide adequate adhesive bond should  \r\n\r\n            be made for each thermocouple by smoothing the existing  \r\n\r\n            surface with a suitable abrasive paper. The material  \r\n\r\n            removed should be the minimum to provide adequate bonding  \r\n\r\n            surface. Where the surface cannot be smoothed, fillings  \r\n\r\n            should be used of minimum quantity to provide a suitable  \r\n\r\n            surface. The filling should comprise a ceramic cement and  \r\n\r\n            when the filled surface is dry it should be smoothed, if  \r\n\r\n            necessary, with abrasive paper.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.5 Construction of thermocouples for measuring the temperature of  \r\n\r\n            the structural core:  \r\n\r\n The thermocouples should be constructed from wires not greater than  \r\n\r\n            0.75 mm in diameter with the hot junctions formed by  \r\n\r\n            welding or crimping (as detailed under 3.1.3). The wires  \r\n\r\n            should be untwisted at the junctions and suitable  \r\n\r\n            insulated. The structural component should be drilled to  \r\n\r\n            receive either the welded junction or the &#187;crimped tip&#171;  \r\n\r\n            and the surrounding structural component material peened  \r\n\r\n            over to lock the thermocouple in position. The depth of  \r\n\r\n            the hole to be drilled in the case of the welded junction  \r\n\r\n            or &#187;crimped tip&#171; should be 2 mm.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.6 Flaming on unexposed side of the specimen:  \r\n\r\n Where flaming occurs on the unexposed side of an &#187;A&#171;, &#187;B&#171;  \r\n\r\n or &#187;F&#171;  \r\n\r\n            class specimen within the duration of the test, the  \r\n\r\n            specimen should be deemed to have failed the test.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.7 Test for penetration of smoke and/or hot gases:  \r\n\r\n The purpose of this test is to indicate whether cracks and openings  \r\n\r\n            formed during the test are such that they would lead to  \r\n\r\n            the passage of smoke and/or hot gases.  \r\n\r\n      .1    Where cracks and openings are formed during the test, an  \r\n\r\n            ignition test as prescribed in 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 should take  \r\n\r\n            place immediately after the appearance of the cracks or  \r\n\r\n            damage followed by similar tests at appropriate intervals.  \r\n\r\n      .2    The cotton wool used for the test prescribed in 4.1.2 and  \r\n\r\n            4.2.2 should consist of new., undyed and soft fibres  \r\n\r\n            without any admixture of artificial fibres, and it should  \r\n\r\n            be free from thread, leaf and shell fibre dust. A suitable  \r\n\r\n            material for this purpose is packaged in the form of rolls  \r\n\r\n            for surgical use. A pad should be cut measuring 100  \r\n\r\n            squaremillimeter and approximately 20 mm in thickness and  \r\n\r\n            weighing between 3 and 4 g. The pad should be oven dried  \r\n\r\n            prior to the test and should be attached by means of wire  \r\n\r\n            clips to a 100 squaremillimeter frame of 1 mm diameter  \r\n\r\n            wire. A wire handle approximately 750 mm in length may be  \r\n\r\n            attached to the frame to facilitate its use on the test  \r\n\r\n            specimen.  \r\n\r\n      .3    When testing for cracks or openings during the test the  \r\n\r\n            pad should be held over the crack or opening  with the  \r\n\r\n            aperture located in the central part of the cotton wool.  \r\n\r\n            Each pad should be applied only once.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.8 Temperature observations during test:  \r\n\r\n      .1    All observations should be taken at intervals not  \r\n\r\n            exceeding 5 minutes. The surface temperatures on the  \r\n\r\n            unexposed side of the test specimen should be measured by  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples located as follows and indicated in figures  \r\n\r\n            1 and 2:  \r\n\r\n      .1.1  Four thermocouples each located approximately in the  \r\n\r\n            centre of a quarter section of the test specimen and at  \r\n\r\n            least 100 mm clear of  any joints.  \r\n\r\n      .1.2  One thermocouple located approximately at the centre of  \r\n\r\n            the test specimen and at least 100 mm clear of any joints:  \r\n\r\n      .1.3  At least one thermocouple placed in way of or as close as  \r\n\r\n            possible to each of the central stiffeners in a specimen  \r\n\r\n            for an &#187;A&#171; class division;  \r\n\r\n      .1.4  At least one thermocouple placed at a joint, if any, at  \r\n\r\n            0.75 height in a specimen of an &#187;A&#171; class division;  \r\n\r\n      .1.5  At least one thermocouple placed at a vertical joint at  \r\n\r\n            0.75 height in a specimen of a &#187;B&#171; or &#187;F&#171;  \r\n\r\n class division;  \r\n\r\n      .1.6  Additional thermocouples at the discretion of the testing  \r\n\r\n            laboratory or Administration for the purpose of  \r\n\r\n            determining the temperature at points deemed likely to  \r\n\r\n            give a greater temperature rise than any of the  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples mentioned in 1.1 and 1.2 above.  \r\n\r\n      .2    The surface temperatures on the unexposed side of an  \r\n\r\n &#187;A&#171;,  \r\n\r\n            &#187;B&#171; or &#187;F&#171; class door should be measured by  \r\n\r\n five  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples located as for a bulkhead in .1.1 and .1.2  \r\n\r\n            above and at least 100 mm clear of the edges of the door,  \r\n\r\n            lock and latch boxes and hinges. The Administration may  \r\n\r\n            require additional thermocouples to be located in way of  \r\n\r\n            or as close as possible to any stiffeners of the door  \r\n\r\n            panels.  \r\n\r\n      .3    The average temperature rise on the unexposed surface of  \r\n\r\n            the test specimen should be obtained as follows:  \r\n\r\n      .3.1  For a specimen of an &#187;A&#171; class division or door by the  \r\n\r\n            average reading of the thermocouples mentioned in .1.1,  \r\n\r\n            .1.2 and .1.3 above.  \r\n\r\n      .3.2  For a specimen of a &#187;B&#171; or &#187;F&#171; class division  \r\n\r\n or door by  \r\n\r\n            the average reading of the thermocouples mentioned in .1.1  \r\n\r\n            and .1.2 above.  \r\n\r\n      .4    Where an Administration requires or permits either an  \r\n\r\n            insulating material for &#187;A&#171; class divisions and  \r\n\r\n &#187;B&#171; class  \r\n\r\n            decks or a material used in the construction of &#187;B&#171; or  \r\n\r\n &#187;F&#171;  \r\n\r\n            class divisions to be tested with a superimposed finish  \r\n\r\n            e.g,. a floor covering material which may have a  \r\n\r\n            detrimental effect on the performance of the &#187;A&#171; class  \r\n\r\n            deck as mentioned in 1.5 and the superimposed finish is  \r\n\r\n            combustible, the finish should be removed in way of the  \r\n\r\n            position in which the thermocouples mentioned in .3 above  \r\n\r\n            are to be placed such that the thermocouples are in  \r\n\r\n            contact with the insulating material. This need not be  \r\n\r\n            done when the superimposed finish is non-combustible.  \r\n\r\n      .5    When testing the specimen with a structural core other  \r\n\r\n            than steel, thermocouples should be fixed to the core  \r\n\r\n            material in positions corresponding to the surface  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples mentioned in .1.1 and .1.2 above to  \r\n\r\n            determine the rise in temperature of the core.  \r\n\r\n 3.1.9 Duration of testing:  \r\n\r\n The test should continue for at least one hour for &#187;A&#171;

</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3 REQUESTS the Maritime Safety Committee to continue in due time work on  \r\n\r\n this subject with a view to further improving the test method. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>ANNEX </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>IMPROVED RECOMMENDATION ON TEST METHOD FOR QUALIFYING MARINE </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AS NON-COMBUSTIBLE </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>1 SCOPE </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>This document specifies a procedure to be used in assessing materials as  \r\n\r\n meeting the requirements for non-combustible materials as specified in  \r\n\r\n Regulation 3 of Chapter II-2 of the International Convention for the Safety  \r\n\r\n of life at Sea, 1974. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>2 FIELD OF APPLICATION </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The test is intended for marine construction materials. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>3 SAMPLING </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The sample should be sufficiently large to be representative of the  \r\n\r\n material, particularly in the case of non-homogeneous materials. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4 APPARATUS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.1 Furnace </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The furnace consists principally of a tube of an aluminia refractory  \r\n\r\n material having a mass density of 3,000 plus/minus 300 kg/cubicmeter and a  \r\n\r\n height of 150 plus/minus 1 mm, with an inner diameter of 75 plus/minus 1 mm  \r\n\r\n and a wall thickness of 10 plus 2/minus 0 mm.(* 6) The overall wall thickness  \r\n\r\n with applied refractory cement to retain the electrical winding should not  \r\n\r\n exceed 13 mm. The furnace tube is provided with one or more electrical  \r\n\r\n heating coils and is located within an insulated surround, completed with a  \r\n\r\n top and bottom plate of marine board having a thickness of 10 plus/minus 1  \r\n\r\n mm. To the lower end of the furnace is attached a cone-shaped air flow  \r\n\r\n stabilizer 500 mm long and reducing from a 75 mm internal diameter at the top  \r\n\r\n to a 9 mm internal diameter at the lower end. The stabilizer can be made of  \r\n\r\n steel sheet, approximately 1 mm thick, and should be finished smooth on the  \r\n\r\n inside, particular attention being given to the smoothness and the tightness  \r\n\r\n of the joint with the furnace which should be provided with a refractory  \r\n\r\n fibre sheet seal. The upper half height of the stabilizer should be insulated  \r\n\r\n on the outside with a layer of refractory fibrous felt having a nominal  \r\n\r\n thickness of 25 mm. At the open top of the furnace a draught shield, which  \r\n\r\n may be made of the same material as the stabilizer cone, should be provided  \r\n\r\n having an internal diameter of 75 mm and a height of 50 mm. The draught  \r\n\r\n shield should be insulated on the outside with a layer of the fibrous felt  \r\n\r\n having a nominal thickness of 25 mm. Details of the furnace are shown in the  \r\n\r\n working drawings.(* 7) A general representation of the furnace is shown in  \r\n\r\n figure 1. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.2 Furnace stand </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The furnace is mounted on a stand with a clearance of approximately 250 mm  \r\n\r\n between the floor and the lower end of the stabilizer. This clearance must be  \r\n\r\n protected against disturbance by air currents. An adequate protection can be  \r\n\r\n provided by using shields around the stand to a height of approximately 550  \r\n\r\n mm from the floor. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.3 Furnace calibration and control </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>A calibrating test with the specimen basket and holder removed should be  \r\n\r\n performed on a new furnace or on an existing furnace when so required. The  \r\n\r\n energy input to the furnace should be adjusted so that the furnace  \r\n\r\n thermocouple (see 4.5) gives a steady of 750 degrees centigrade plus/minus 10  \r\n\r\n degrees centigrade. In stabilized conditions the wall temperature at the  \r\n\r\n furnace should be measured by an optical micropyrometer at intervals of 10 mm  \r\n\r\n on three equally spaced vertical axos. The wall temperature should not vary  \r\n\r\n by more than 50 degrees centigrade over a mid-height length of 100 mm and  \r\n\r\n this should give an average wall temperature of about 850 degrees centigrade.  \r\n\r\n This provides a constant temperature zone for the specimen and can be  \r\n\r\n achieved by having the electric windings spaces as shown in working drawings.  \r\n\r\n Separate windings may optionally be provided at each end of the furnace tube,  \r\n\r\n controlled independently to obtain the constant temperature zone. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>To minimize temperature fluctuations in the furnace it is necessary to use  \r\n\r\n a voltage stabilizer in the circuit, able to maintain voltage within  \r\n\r\n plus/minus 5 per cent of the nominal value. Automatic thermostatic control of  \r\n\r\n the furnace is not to be used during test. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.4 Temperature measurement </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Temperatures should be measured by means of insulated sheathed  \r\n\r\n thermocouples having an outside diameter of 1.5 plus/minus 0.1 mm with  \r\n\r\n thermo-electric wires of approximately 0.2 mm diameter. Before using for  \r\n\r\n test, new thermocouples should be aged in the heated furnace atmosphere to  \r\n\r\n slightly oxidize their outer sheaths. The temperature should be recorded by  \r\n\r\n an instrument having a measuring range that corresponds with the temperature  \r\n\r\n changes that occur during the tests. Measurement should be made at intervals  \r\n\r\n of not more than 10 seconds. The electromotive force temperature conversion  \r\n\r\n process of the recording device use should have an accuracy of at least 0.5  \r\n\r\n per cent, and the thermocouples should have a time constant in the range of  \r\n\r\n 15 to 25 seconds.(* 8) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.5 Location of thermocouples </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Three thermocouples should be used, the furnace thermocouple to measure  \r\n\r\n the furnace temperature, the surface thermocouple to measure the temperature  \r\n\r\n at the surface of the specimen and the specimen thermocouple to measure the  \r\n\r\n temperature in the centre of the specimen. The furnace thermocouple should be  \r\n\r\n located with its hot junction 10 plus/minus 0.5 mm from the wall of the  \r\n\r\n furnace and at the mid-height of the constant temperature zone as defined by  \r\n\r\n the wall temperature (see figure 2). A method of maintaining the correct  \r\n\r\n distance from the wall is by the use of a guide attached to the draught  \r\n\r\n shield. The surface thermocouple should, prior to the test, have its hot  \r\n\r\n junction next to the surface of the specimen at mid-height and be in contact  \r\n\r\n with the specimen. The specimen thermocouple should be located with its hot  \r\n\r\n junction in the centre of the specimen and should be inserted from the top  \r\n\r\n through a hole of 2 mm diameter. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.6 Specimen holder and insertion device </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The specimen is placed in a basket made of nickel-chromium alloy or  \r\n\r\n heat-resisting steel. At the bottom of the holder, a fine metal gauze in  \r\n\r\n heat-resisting steel should be provided. The mass of the basket should be  \r\n\r\n between 6 plus/minus 0.2 g. The holder is suspended from the lower end of an  \r\n\r\n adjustable tube of heat-resisting steel, having an outside diameter of  \r\n\r\n approximately 6 mm and a bore of 4 mm. The specimen insertion device consists  \r\n\r\n essentially of a metallic sliding rod moving freely in a vertical tube fitted  \r\n\r\n to the side of the furnace. The heat-resisting steel tube with the specimen  \r\n\r\n holder is fixed by a space bar to the sliding rod. The design of the  \r\n\r\n insertion device should be such that the specimen can be introduced into the  \r\n\r\n furnace rapidly and without any shock. The inserted specimen should occupy a  \r\n\r\n specified position in the furnace in the middle of the constant temperature  \r\n\r\n zone and equidistant from the walls. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>4.7 Specimen viewing device </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>A mirror should be mounted above the furnace for observation of any  \r\n\r\n evidence of flaming. It should be mounted in such a way that it is possible  \r\n\r\n to view the specimen continuously following insertion. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5 TEST SPECIMENS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.1 Preparation of specimens </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The specimens should be as representative as possible of the average  \r\n\r\n properties of the sample and should be prepared to the size defined in 5.2.  \r\n\r\n</P>  \r\n\r\n<P>If the thickness of the material is less than 50 mm, the specimen must be  \r\n\r\n made of sufficient layers to achieve the thickness required in 5.2. The  \r\n\r\n layers should occupy a horizontal position and should be held together firmly  \r\n\r\n in the specimen holder. The density of the specimen should be representative  \r\n\r\n of the density of the material. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Materials or composite materials which involve thin surface laminations  \r\n\r\n should be tested without such surface laminates unless otherwise specified by  \r\n\r\n the Administration involved. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>For composite materials of a thickness such that a number of layers cannot  \r\n\r\n be put together to give a specimen of the specified size as required in 5.2,  \r\n\r\n the specimen should be prepared to the required thickness by proportionally  \r\n\r\n adjusting the thickness of the different components. The top and bottom faces  \r\n\r\n of the specimen should be the finished faces of the material. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>If it is not possible to follow this procedure to prepare the specimen,  \r\n\r\n tests should be performed on the individual components and reported  \r\n\r\n accordingly. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.2 Number and size </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>For test purposes, five cylindrical specimens should be prepared as  \r\n\r\n described in 5.1. The nominal dimensions and tolerances for the specimen  \r\n\r\n sizes are as follows: </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n      diameter:   45 plus 0/minus 2 mm  \r\n\r\n      height:     50 plus/minus 3 mm  \r\n\r\n      volumne:   80 plus/minus 5 cubiccentimeter  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P>5.3 Conditioning </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The specimens should be conditioned in a ventilated oven maintained at 60  \r\n\r\n degrees centigrade plus/minus 5 degrees centigrade for at least 20 hours and  \r\n\r\n cooled to ambient temperature in a desiccator prior to the test. The weight  \r\n\r\n of each specimen shall be determined before test. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6 PROCEDURE </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.1 Apparatus </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Before starting the test, it is necessary to ascertain that the whole  \r\n\r\n equipment is in good working order - for example, the stabilizer cone is  \r\n\r\n clean, the insertion device is working smoothly, the specimen holder occupies  \r\n\r\n the exact position in the furnace and the furnace thermocouple is accurately  \r\n\r\n located </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The equipment should be protected against draughts and not be exposed to  \r\n\r\n direct sunlight or artificial illumination. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The furnace with an empty specimen basket in position (figure 2) should be  \r\n\r\n heated and the furnace temperature stabilized at 750 degrees centigrade  \r\n\r\n plus/minus 10 degrees centigrade.

The weight of each specimen after test  \r\n\r\n shall be determined. Sustained flaming shall be taken as continuous presence  \r\n\r\n of flames in the furnace. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>6.5 Number of specimens tested </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The test is carried out on five specimens, prepared as specified in 5.1  \r\n\r\n and 5.2. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7 CLASSIFICATION OF MATERIALS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.1 Non-combustibility </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>A material should be deemed non-combustible, if: </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n      .1    the average of the five maximum readings of furnace  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples does not show a rise above the initial  \r\n\r\n            furnace temperature of more than 50degrees centigrade;(*  \r\n\r\n            9)  \r\n\r\n      .2    the average of the five maximum readings of surface  \r\n\r\n            thermocouples does not show a rise above the initial  \r\n\r\n            furnace temperature of more than 50degrees centigrade;(*  \r\n\r\n            9)  \r\n\r\n      .3    the average of all recorded maximum durations of sustained  \r\n\r\n            flaming does not exceed 10 seconds; and  \r\n\r\n      .4     the average loss of weight for the specimens after test  \r\n\r\n            is not more than 50 per cent of the original weight after  \r\n\r\n            conditioning.  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P>7.2 Combustibility </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>If one of the four criteria is not satisfied the material is deemed  \r\n\r\n combustible. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>8 TEST REPORT </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n      The test report should include the following information:  \r\n\r\n      .1    name of testing body;  \r\n\r\n      .2    name of manufacturer of the material;  \r\n\r\n      .3    date of supply of the materials and of tests;  \r\n\r\n      .4    name or identification mark of the material;  \r\n\r\n      .5    description of the material;  \r\n\r\n      .6    density of the material;  \r\n\r\n      .7    description of the specimens (only for composite  \r\n\r\n            material);  \r\n\r\n      .8    test method;  \r\n\r\n      .9    test results including all temperature curves and  \r\n\r\n            observations;  \r\n\r\n      .10   designation of the material according to the test criteria  \r\n\r\n            specified in section 7.  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=66750&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>RESOLUTION A.214(VII) </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>IMPROVED PROVISIONAL GUIDELINES ON TEST </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>PROCEDURES FOR PRIMARY DECK COVERINGS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The Assembly, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Nothing Article 16(i) on the Convention on the Inter-Governmental Maritime  \r\n\r\n Consultative Organization concerning the functions of the Assembly, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Noting also Regulations 41 and 54 and proposed Regulation 105 of Chapter  \r\n\r\n II of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960,  \r\n\r\n concerning deck coverings, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Noting further Recommendation 11 of the International Conference on the  \r\n\r\n Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, concerning fire test procedures, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Recalling Resolution A.165(ES.IV) by which it adopted Provisional  \r\n\r\n Guidelines on Test Procedures for Deck Coverings, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Desiring to improve these Provisional Guidelines, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Having considered the Recommendation by the Maritime Safety Committee at  \r\n\r\n its twenty-second session, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Adopts the Improved Provisional Guidelines on Test Procedures for Primary  \r\n\r\n Deck Coverings as set out at Annex to this Resolution, which supersede the  \r\n\r\n Provisional Guidelines adopted by Resolution A.165(ES.IV), </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Invites all governments concern to take appropriate steps to give effect  \r\n\r\n to the Improved Provisional Guidelines as soon as possible, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Requests the Maritime safety Committee to continue its study on this  \r\n\r\n subject, </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Authorizes the Maritime Safety Committee to amend the Guidelines if  \r\n\r\n necessary in the light of such study. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>ANNEX </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>IMPROVED PROVISIONAL GUIDELINES ON TEST </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>PROCEDURES FOR PRIMARY DECK COVERINGS </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Foreword </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>1.</B> The present specification is intended to provide  \r\n\r\n information to Administrations, laboratories and other interested bodies  \r\n\r\n concerning the assessment of requisite properties of primary deck coverings.  \r\n\r\n The work of the Organization in this field has not yet been finalized, and  \r\n\r\n there are certain difficulties in the interpretation of relevant provisions  \r\n\r\n of the 1960 safety Convention. These guidelines provide improved test  \r\n\r\n procedures for deck coverings and supersede those previously formulated in  \r\n\r\n Resolution A.165(ES.IV), but are still of provisional character. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>2.</B> The fire resistance aspects of deck coverings or  \r\n\r\n primary deck coverings are mentioned in Chapter II of the International  \r\n\r\n Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, in three distinct situations,  \r\n\r\n namely: (a) in cargo ships over 4,000 gross tons (Regulation 54(c)); (b) in  \r\n\r\n passenger ships (Regulation 41); (c) in future passenger ships (Regulation  \r\n\r\n 105(h)). </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>3.</B> The test method described in this document is  \r\n\r\n intended to provide guidelines for qualifying primary deck coverings as  \r\n\r\n acceptable with respect to the above referenced requirements. The method  \r\n\r\n described is only applicable to situations in which a fire occurs in the  \r\n\r\n compartment below the deck. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>4.</B> When doubts exist relative to the fire hazard  \r\n\r\n characteristics of the upper exposed surface of permanently attached deck  \r\n\r\n coverings, Administrations are encouraged to apply such flammability and  \r\n\r\n other test methods considered necessary for their evaluation. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Application </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>5.</B> The following considerations should be recognized  \r\n\r\n in application of the described test: (a) The test is only required when the  \r\n\r\n thickness of the material applied directly to the steel plate is equal to or  \r\n\r\n exceeds 5 mm. Thin paint films and bonding agents are exempted from  \r\n\r\n considerations as the material directly applied to the steel plate. (b) In  \r\n\r\n general only the first layer should be tested. However, in case an  \r\n\r\n Administration considers that some substantial difference of fire performance  \r\n\r\n may result from the application of successive layers then the Administration  \r\n\r\n may consider it desirable to perform qualification tests on the complete  \r\n\r\n assembly. (c) The test is required where the fire insulation to be installed  \r\n\r\n is no more than the minimum specified in parts D and H of Chapter II of the  \r\n\r\n 1960 Safety Convention. If additional insulation is provided the  \r\n\r\n Administration may consider the possibility of acceptance of deck coverings  \r\n\r\n on the basis of a complete fire resistance test in which case a separate test  \r\n\r\n for deck coverings need not be superimposed. In any case test considered here  \r\n\r\n should be conducted without the use of insulation below the steel plate  \r\n\r\n specimen. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>6.</B> The test equipment and procedures described below  \r\n\r\n are intended for determining whether or not deck coverings &#187;readily  \r\n\r\n ignite&#171;, release excessive smoke and/or exude gases which are toxic or  \r\n\r\n combustible. The methods described are not intended for evaluating the  \r\n\r\n effectiveness of the deck coverings as a portion of the required insulation  \r\n\r\n of an A or B Class division. For this purpose the fire resistance test is  \r\n\r\n required. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>7.</B> It is felt that the attention of Administrations  \r\n\r\n should be specially drawn to the nature of the test which simulates a deck  \r\n\r\n with no protection underneath. It is important that Administrations should  \r\n\r\n determine the validity of this procedure before applying it to other  \r\n\r\n situations. When determining the ignitability of deck coverings from a fire  \r\n\r\n source from above a different technique will be required: a simple  \r\n\r\n ignitability or flame spread test would be suitable for this purpose. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Description of specimen </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>8.</B> The primary deck covering as intended to be tested  \r\n\r\n should be applied to a mild steel plate of a nominal thickness of 5 mm. The  \r\n\r\n overall size of the steel plate should be such that it exceeds the opening of  \r\n\r\n the furnace by 25 mm plus/minus 5 mm on all sides. Three specimens should be  \r\n\r\n prepared for test on each type of deck covering. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Conditions of specimen </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>9.</B> The test specimens should be conditioned to  \r\n\r\n equilibrium with an atmosphere of relative humidity between 40-70 per cent at  \r\n\r\n a temperature of 20 plus/minus 5 degrees centigrade. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Description of furnace </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>10.</B> The tests should be performed on a furnace with a  \r\n\r\n rectangular horizontal opening with sides measuring 600 mm plus/minus 100  \r\n\r\n internally. The internal depth of the furnace should be such as to prevent  \r\n\r\n the direct impingement of flames if any to the underside of the specimens,  \r\n\r\n the depth should not be less than 100 mm in any case. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Measurements of furnace temperature </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>11.</B> The temperature condition within the furnace  \r\n\r\n during a test should be determined by means of at least three rapid response  \r\n\r\n thermocouples positioned, within the opening along one diagonal, one at the  \r\n\r\n centre and the other two at quarter points. The furnace should be calibrated  \r\n\r\n to ensure as uniform heating as possible. The hot junctions of the  \r\n\r\n thermocouples should be approximately 50 mm from the underside of the deck  \r\n\r\n specimen. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Furnace control </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>12.</B> The furnace temperature should be continuously  \r\n\r\n controlled so as to follow the standard time/temperature curve starting at  \r\n\r\n room temperature and defined by a smooth curve drawn through the following  \r\n\r\n points: At the end of the first 5 minutes 538 degrees centigrade At the end  \r\n\r\n of the first 10 minutes 704 degrees centigrade At the end of the first 15  \r\n\r\n minutes 760 degrees centigrade At the end of the first 30 minutes 843 degrees  \r\n\r\n centigrade </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The accuracy of the furnace control should be such that the area under the  \r\n\r\n curve of the mean furnace temperature should not vary by more than plus/minus  \r\n\r\n 10 per cent of the area under the standard curve. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Test flame </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>13.</B> A test flame, 15-20 mm in length, should be used  \r\n\r\n to measure the ignitability of the deck covering. A possible arrangement for  \r\n\r\n a test flame is shown in Figure 1. The flame should be of luminous type  \r\n\r\n produced by the combustion of a hydrocarbon gas. Other suitable means may be  \r\n\r\n employed for the ignition of the gases emitted by the deck covering. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Smoke collection canopy </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>14.</B> A chamber or canopy for collection of smoke and  \r\n\r\n gases above the specimen should be constructed of steel as defined by the  \r\n\r\n drawings shown in Figures 2 and 3. The number and size of holes as well as  \r\n\r\n the dimensions indicated should be closely complied with. This canopy may be  \r\n\r\n finished with any heat and corrosion resistant finish desired. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Measurement of light obscuration </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>15.</B> A photometer for measurement of light transmission  \r\n\r\n through the gases collected by the canopy should be constructed as shown by  \r\n\r\n drawings in Figures 2 and 4. The dimensions shown for the light source and  \r\n\r\n detector should be considered typical rather than critical. It is, however,  \r\n\r\n highly recommended that the baffle with an aperture of not larger than 5 mm  \r\n\r\n diameter be used as shown. This device serves to greatly reduce the effects  \r\n\r\n of extraneous light causing errors in transmission measurements. Both the  \r\n\r\n light source and detector enclosures should be constructed in such a manner  \r\n\r\n that smoke cannot accumulate within them. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>16.</B> Figure 5 shows the circuit diagram for connexion  \r\n\r\n of the electrical parts of the system. One suitable type of light detector  \r\n\r\n used can be of the vacuum photo emissive type with a spectral response  \r\n\r\n roughly corresponding to that of the human eye (an RCA 1P39 tube has been  \r\n\r\n found suitable). As indicated in Figure 5 the resistive load of this detector  \r\n\r\n may be either a circuit component or a part of the measuring instrument but  \r\n\r\n should remain constant for all ranges of instrument sensitivity. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>17.</B> The measuring instrument, not shown, should  \r\n\r\n preferable be of the recording type with provision for rapid easy change of  \r\n\r\n measuring voltage sensitivity over three decades. A recording vacuum tube  \r\n\r\n voltmeter with full scale sensitivity variable in three steps from 0.1 to 10  \r\n\r\n volts would be adequate for this purpose. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>18.</B> The lamp used should be operated at approximately  \r\n\r\n its design voltage although small changes in supply voltage may be made to  \r\n\r\n permit adjustment of full scale indication of the measuring instrument in the  \r\n\r\n absence of smoke. Initial coarse adjustment of output of the photometer  \r\n\r\n circuit may be accomplished either by changes of battery voltage or  \r\n\r\n resistance of the photo detector load circuit. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>19.</B> The smoke measurements are reported in terms of  \r\n\r\n optical density. </P>  \r\n\r\n<PRE>  \r\n\r\n                                   100  \r\n\r\n This property is defined as log10 --- where T is the percentage  \r\n\r\n                                    T  \r\n\r\n</PRE>  \r\n\r\n<P>fraction of the incident light that is received by the photo detector. The  \r\n\r\n optical density may be obtained directly by plotting the transmission on the  \r\n\r\n cart Figure 6 and interpolating linearly between the indicated optical  \r\n\r\n density shown. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Test procedure </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>20.</B> The specimen should be placed to close the furnace  \r\n\r\n opening with the deck covering uppermost. Precautions should be taken to  \r\n\r\n prevent escape of gases around the edges of specimen. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>21.</B> In arranging the canopy and photometer on the  \r\n\r\n upper surface of the specimen the photometer should be placed to lie across  \r\n\r\n the width or length of the specimen whichever most nearly corresponds to a  \r\n\r\n dimension of 550 mm. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>22.</B> Since draughts blowing across the surface of the  \r\n\r\n specimen during a test would seriously influence smoke measurements,  \r\n\r\n precautions should be taken to ensure that such conditions do not occur  \r\n\r\n during a test. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Test of ignitability </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>23.</B> Two specimens should be tested without using the  \r\n\r\n smoke collection canopy and each test should be of 15 minutes' duration. The  \r\n\r\n test flame specified in paragraph 13 should be applied to the top of the deck  \r\n\r\n covering before the commencement of heating and then at one minute intervals  \r\n\r\n from the first evidence of the evolution of gases from the specimen surface.  \r\n\r\n During each application, the test flame or the other device for the same  \r\n\r\n purpose should be moved over the whole surface of the specimen. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Test for smoke production </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>24.</B> One specimen should be tested and the test should  \r\n\r\n be of a thirty minute duration. The smoke collection canopy shown in Figures  \r\n\r\n 2 and 3 should be placed in position on top of the specimen. The sensitivity  \r\n\r\n range of the measuring instruments should be changed during the test to  \r\n\r\n maintain the meter deflection at a value greater than 10 per cent of the full  \r\n\r\n scale. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Test for toxic products </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>25.</B> Spot checks should be made during the test in  \r\n\r\n paragraph 23 to determine the nature of the toxic products given off. During  \r\n\r\n the course of the test in paragraph 24 samples of gases should be taken at  \r\n\r\n intervals from the central top opening of the canopy. These may be analyzed  \r\n\r\n directly by colorimetric gas indicators or by other suitable gas analysis  \r\n\r\n methods. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Observations during test </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>26.</B> The following observations and records should be  \r\n\r\n made during the tests as appropriate: (a) Time of occurrence of any flaming  \r\n\r\n and its characteristics such as location, duration, height, etc. (b) A record  \r\n\r\n of the variation of light transmission through the canopy during the test.  \r\n\r\n The data should be plotted as optical density on a graph as in Figure 6. (c)  \r\n\r\n A record should be kept of the concentration of toxic products measured  \r\n\r\n during the test. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Assessment of performance </P>  \r\n\r\n<P CLASS=PUNKT> <B>27.</B> The performance of the specimens should be  \r\n\r\n indicated under the following headings: (a) Ignitability The deck covering  \r\n\r\n should be classified as &#187;not readily ignitable&#171; if with neither  \r\n\r\n specimen is there any continuous flaming during the 15 minutes' test. Any  \r\n\r\n flaming continuing for 10 seconds or more after the local application of the  \r\n\r\n test flame should be considered as continuous flaming. (b) Smoke Time of  \r\n\r\n occurrence and duration for which the optical density exceeds values of 1.0  \r\n\r\n and 2.0 should be given. (c) Toxic gases Type of gases and their  \r\n\r\n concentration should be plotted as a function of time. </P>  \r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC=\"/image.aspx?id=66750&img=1.gif\" ALIGN=\"middle\" WIDTH=\"235\" HEIGHT=\"85 BORDER=\"no\" ALT=\"DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt onMouseOver=\"self.status='DUMMY.GIF billedet er ikke indlagt'; return true\"\"> </P>  \r\n\r\n</DIV><div class=\"bjelke\">Officielle noter</div><DIV CLASS=PARA ID=\"NOTER\"> \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>(* 1) NU IMO Res.
